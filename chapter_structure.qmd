Brainstorming chapter structures with the help of various AI assistants:




----

## Alternative 1

1. **Human-AI Teaming and Collaboration**:
   - Papers that explore how LLMs collaborate with humans in decision-making, problem-solving, and teamwork contexts. 
   - Example: "Human-AI teaming: Leveraging transactive memory and speaking up for enhanced team effectiveness" .

2. **LLMs as Models for Social and Group Dynamics**:
   - Papers that investigate how LLMs simulate or replicate human group behavior, including group decision-making, social interactions, and collective intelligence.
   - Example: "The Wisdom of Partisan Crowds: Comparing Collective Intelligence in Humans and LLM-based Agents" .

3. **LLMs in Decision-Making and Game Theory**:
   - Papers that focus on the decision-making abilities of LLMs, including their performance in structured games and strategic contexts.
   - Example: "Can Large Language Models Serve as Rational Players in Game Theory?" .

4. **Evaluation of LLM Capabilities and Limitations**:
   - Papers that assess the reasoning, problem-solving, and decision-making capabilities of LLMs, often by comparing them to human performance.
   - Example: "LLM-Deliberation: Evaluating LLMs with Interactive Multi-Agent Negotiation Games" .

5. **Ethical and Societal Implications of LLM Use**:
   - Papers that address the ethical, societal, and policy-related considerations associated with the use of LLMs in human-centered contexts.
   - Example: "Large language models cannot replace human participants because they cannot portray identity groups".

## Alternative 2

1. Collective Intelligence and Decision Making
This category focuses on how LLMs can be used to simulate or enhance collective intelligence, group decision-making processes, and wisdom of crowds phenomena.

2. Multi-Agent Systems and Collaboration
This category includes papers that explore interactions between multiple LLM agents, their collaborative behaviors, and emergent properties in multi-agent systems.

3. Human-AI Teaming and Interaction
This category covers research on the integration of LLMs with human teams, human-AI collaboration, and the use of LLMs to augment human capabilities in various domains.

4. Social Behavior and Network Dynamics
This category encompasses studies that investigate whether LLMs exhibit human-like social behaviors, network formation tendencies, and how they might influence or simulate social dynamics.
