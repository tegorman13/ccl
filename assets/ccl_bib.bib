  abstract = {There is a growing interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents to tackle real-world tasks that may require assessing complex situations. Yet, we have a limited understanding of LLMs' reasoning and decision-making capabilities, partly stemming from a lack of dedicated evaluation benchmarks. As negotiating and compromising are key aspects of our everyday communication and collaboration, we propose using scorable negotiation games as a new evaluation framework for LLMs. We create a testbed of diverse text-based, multi-agent, multi-issue, semantically rich negotiation games, with easily tunable difficulty. To solve the challenge, agents need to have strong arithmetic, inference, exploration, and planning capabilities, while seamlessly integrating them. Via a systematic zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT), we show that agents can negotiate and consistently reach successful deals. We quantify the performance with multiple metrics and observe a large gap between GPT-4 and earlier models. Importantly, we test the generalization to new games and setups. Finally, we show that these games can help evaluate other critical aspects, such as the interaction dynamics between agents in the presence of greedy and adversarial players.},

However, simple relations of this type can often be recovered heuristically and the extent to which models implicitly reflect topological structure that is grounded in world, such as perceptual structure, is unknown. To explore this question, we conduct a thorough case study on color. Namely, we employ a dataset of monolexemic color terms and color chips represented in CIELAB, a color space with a perceptually meaningful distance metric. Using two methods of evaluating the structural alignment of colors in this space with text-derived color term representations, we find significant correspondence. Analyzing the differences in alignment across the color spectrum, we find that warmer colors are, on average, better aligned to the perceptual color space than cooler ones, suggesting an intriguing connection to findings from recent work on efficient communication in color naming. Further analysis suggests that differences in alignment are, in part, mediated by collocationality and differences in syntactic usage, posing questions as to the relationship between color perception and usage and context.},

Beyond existing general guidelines, we investigate the current limitations, ethical implications, and potential of LLMs specifically for psychological research, and show their concrete impact in various empirical studies. Our results highlight the importance of recognizing global psychological diversity, cautioning against treating LLMs (especially in zero-shot settings) as universal solutions for text analysis, and developing transparent, open methods to address LLMs' opaque nature for reliable, reproducible, and robust inference from AI-generated data. Acknowledging LLMs' utility for task automation, such as text annotation, or to expand our understanding of human psychology, we argue for diversifying human samples and expanding psychology's methodological toolbox to promote an inclusive, generalizable science, countering homogenization, and over-reliance on LLMs.},

  abstract = {This article reviews and evaluates the effectiveness of interventions aiming to encourage households to reduce energy consumption. Thirty-eight studies performed within the field of (applied) social and environmental psychology are reviewed, and categorized as involving either antecedent strategies (i.e. commitment, goal setting, information, modeling) or consequence strategies (i.e. feedback, rewards). Particular attention is given to the following evaluation criteria: (1) to what extent did the intervention result in behavioral changes and/or reductions in energy use, (2) were underlying behavioral determinants examined (e.g. knowledge, attitudes), (3) to what extent could effects be attributed to the interventions and, (4) were effects maintained over longer periods of time? Interestingly, most studies focus on voluntary behavior change, by changing individual knowledge and/or perceptions rather than changing contextual factors (i.e. pay-off structure) which may determine households' behavioral decisions. Interventions have been employed with varying degrees of success. Information tends to result in higher knowledge levels, but not necessarily in behavioral changes or energy savings. Rewards have effectively encouraged energy conservation, but with rather short-lived effects. Feedback has also proven its merits, in particular when given frequently. Some important issues cloud these conclusions, such as methodological problems. Also, little attention is given to actual environmental impact of energy savings. Often, an intervention's effectiveness is studied without examining underlying psychological determinants of energy use and energy savings. Also, it is not always clear whether effects were maintained over a longer period of time. Recommendations are given to further improve intervention planning and to enhance the effectiveness of interventions.},

Hence, it is important to understand the biases present in their outputs in order to avoid perpetuating harmful stereotypes, which originate in our own flawed ways of thinking. This challenge requires developing new benchmarks and methods for quantifying affective and semantic bias, keeping in mind that LLMs act as psycho-social mirrors that reflect the views and tendencies that are prevalent in society. One such tendency that has harmful negative effects is the global phenomenon of anxiety toward math and STEM subjects. In this study, we introduce a novel application of network science and cognitive psychology to understand biases towards math and STEM fields in LLMs from ChatGPT, such as GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4. Specifically, we use behavioral forma mentis networks (BFMNs) to understand how these LLMs frame math and STEM disciplines in relation to other concepts. We use data obtained by probing the three LLMs in a language generation task that has previously been applied to humans. Our findings indicate that LLMs have negative perceptions of math and STEM fields, associating math with negative concepts in 6 cases out of 10. We observe significant differences across OpenAI's models: newer versions (i.e., GPT-4) produce 5{\texttimes} semantically richer, more emotionally polarized perceptions with fewer negative associations compared to older versions and N=159 high-school students. These findings suggest that advances in the architecture of LLMs may lead to increasingly less biased models that could even perhaps someday aid in reducing harmful stereotypes in society rather than perpetuating them.},

Their significance in design lies in their transformative potential to support engineers and collaborate with design teams throughout the design process. However, it is not known whether LLMs can emulate the cognitive and social attributes which are known to be important during design, such as cognitive style. This research evaluates the efficacy of LLMs to emulate aspects of Kirton's Adaption-Innovation theory, which characterizes individual preferences in problem-solving. Specifically, we use LLMs to generate solutions for three design problems using two different cognitive style prompts (adaptively-framed and innovatively-framed). Solutions are evaluated with respect to feasibility and paradigm relatedness, which are known to have discriminative value in other studies of cognitive style. We found that solutions generated using the adaptive prompt tend to display higher feasibility and are paradigm preserving, while solutions generated using the innovative prompts were more paradigm modifying. This aligns with prior work and expectations for design behavior based on Kirton's Adaption-Innovation theory. Ultimately, these results demonstrate that LLMs can be prompted to accurately emulate cognitive style.},

In order to address concerns of exposure to these studies in training data, we also evaluate simulations on novel variants of these studies. We show that it is possible to simulate responses of different people and that their responses are largely consistent with prior human studies from the literature.

However, despite the revolutionizing prospect of MLLMs, our understanding of their reasoning abilities is limited. In this study, we assess the nonverbal abstract reasoning abilities of open-source and closed-source MLLMs using variations of Raven's Progressive Matrices. Our experiments expose the difficulty of solving such problems while showcasing the immense gap between open-source and closed-source models. We also reveal critical shortcomings with individual visual and textual modules, subjecting the models to low-performance ceilings.

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) are transforming society and permeating into diverse applications. As a result, LLMs will frequently interact with us and other agents. It is, therefore, of great societal value to understand how LLMs behave in interactive social settings. Here, we propose to use behavioral game theory to study LLM's cooperation and coordination behavior. To do so, we let different LLMs (GPT-3, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) play finitely repeated games with each other and with other, human-like strategies. Our results show that LLMs generally perform well in such tasks and also uncover persistent behavioral signatures. In a large set of two players-two strategies games, we find that LLMs are particularly good at games where valuing their own self-interest pays off, like the iterated Prisoner's Dilemma family. However, they behave sub-optimally in games that require coordination. We, therefore, further focus on two games from these distinct families. In the canonical iterated Prisoner's Dilemma, we find that GPT-4 acts particularly unforgivingly, always defecting after another agent has defected only once. In the Battle of the Sexes, we find that GPT-4 cannot match the behavior of the simple convention to alternate between options. We verify that these behavioral signatures are stable across robustness checks. Finally, we show how GPT-4's behavior can be modified by providing further information about the other player as well as by asking it to predict the other player's actions before making a choice. These results enrich our understanding of LLM's social behavior and pave the way for a behavioral game theory for machines.},

In this study, we explored how extant findings on searching translate to a real-world environment, using a phenomenologically informed experiment. Our findings demonstrate a previously undescribed complex and dynamic interplay of different search strategies. Importantly, our results reveal that: (i) the presence of other people is importantly entangled with the process of searching; and (ii) people frequently probe and switch between search strategies based on local environmental characteristics. Together, our results reveal that search behaviour is critically dependent on environmental features and that searching in complex real-world settings should not be conceptualised as depending on a simple singular strategy. This raises questions about the dominance of laboratory-based experiments and their narrow cognitivist framework, highlighting the value of studying wayfinding in the real world.},

Methodology: In this paper, a recommendation system is proposed with the purpose of assisting users of electric vehicles in locating charging stations that are closer to them, improving the charging experience, and lowering range anxiety. The proposed method is based on restricted Boltzmann machine learning to collect and evaluate real-time data on a variety of aspects, including the availability of charging stations and historical patterns of consumption. To optimize the parameters of the restricted Boltzmann machine, a new optimization algorithm is proposed and referred to as parallel greylag goose (PGGO) algorithm. The recommendation algorithm takes into consideration a variety of user preferences. These preferences include charging speed, cost, network compatibility, amenities, and proximity to the user's present location. By addressing these preferences, the proposed approach reduces the amount of irritation experienced by users, improves charging performance, and increases customer satisfaction. Results: The findings demonstrate that the method is effective in recommending charging stations that are close to drivers of electric vehicles. On the other hand, the Wilcoxon rank-sum and Analysis of Variance tests are utilized in this work to investigate the statistical significance of the proposed parallel greylag goose optimization method and restricted Boltzmann machine model. The proposed methodology could achieve a recommendation accuracy of 99\% when tested on the adopted dataset. Conclusion: Based on the achieved results, the proposed method is effective in recommending systems for the best charging stations for electric vehicles.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have garnered a great deal of attention for their exceptional generative performance on commonsense and reasoning tasks. In this work, we investigate LLMs' capabilities for generalization using a particularly challenging type of statement: generics. Generics express generalizations (e.g., birds can fly) but do so without explicit quantification. They are notable because they generalize over their instantiations (e.g., sparrows can fly) yet hold true even in the presence of exceptions (e.g., penguins do not). For humans, these generic generalization play a fundamental role in cognition, concept acquisition, and intuitive reasoning. We investigate how LLMs respond to and reason about generics. To this end, we first propose a framework grounded in pragmatics to automatically generate both exceptions and instantiations -- collectively exemplars. We make use of focus -- a pragmatic phenomenon that highlights meaning-bearing elements in a sentence -- to capture the full range of interpretations of generics across different contexts of use. This allows us to derive precise logical definitions for exemplars and operationalize them to automatically generate exemplars from LLMs. Using our system, we generate a dataset of {$\sim$}370k exemplars across {$\sim$}17k generics and conduct a human validation of a sample of the generated data. We use our final generated dataset to investigate how LLMs' reason about generics. Humans have a documented tendency to conflate universally quantified statements (e.g., all birds can fly) with generics. Therefore, we probe whether LLMs exhibit similar overgeneralization behavior in terms of quantification and in property inheritance. We find that LLMs do show evidence of overgeneralization, although they sometimes struggle to reason about exceptions. Furthermore, we find that LLMs may exhibit similar non-logical behavior to humans when considering property inheritance from generics.},

However, which individual attributes best predict group performance remains poorly understood. Here, we describe a preregistered experiment in which we simultaneously manipulated four widely studied attributes of group compositions: skill level, skill diversity, social perceptiveness, and cognitive style diversity. We find that while the average skill level of group members, skill diversity, and social perceptiveness are significant predictors of group performance, skill level dominates all other factors combined. Additionally, we explore the relationship between patterns of collaborative behavior and performance outcomes and find that any potential gains in solution quality from additional communication between the group members are outweighed by the overhead time cost, leading to lower overall efficiency. However, groups exhibiting more ``turn-taking'' behavior are considerably faster and thus more efficient. Finally, contrary to our expectation, we find that group compositional factors (i.e., skill level and social perceptiveness) are not associated with the amount of communication between group members nor turn-taking dynamics.},

  abstract = {The dominant paradigm of experiments in the social and behavioral sciences views an experiment as a test of a theory, where the theory is assumed to generalize beyond the experiment's specific conditions. According to this view, which Alan Newell once characterized as ``playing twenty questions with nature,'' theory is advanced one experiment at a time, and the integration of disparate findings is assumed to happen via the scientific publishing process. In this article, we argue that the process of integration is at best inefficient, and at worst it does not, in fact, occur. We further show that the challenge of integration cannot be adequately addressed by recently proposed reforms that focus on the reliability and replicability of individual findings, nor simply by conducting more or larger experiments. Rather, the problem arises from the imprecise nature of social and behavioral theories and, consequently, a lack of commensurability across experiments conducted under different conditions. Therefore, researchers must fundamentally rethink how they design experiments and how the experiments relate to theory. We specifically describe an alternative framework, integrative experiment design, which intrinsically promotes commensurability and continuous integration of knowledge. In this paradigm, researchers explicitly map the design space of possible experiments associated with a given research question, embracing many potentially relevant theories rather than focusing on just one. Researchers then iteratively generate theories and test them with experiments explicitly sampled from the design space, allowing results to be integrated across experiments. Given recent methodological and technological developments, we conclude that this approach is feasible and would generate more-reliable, more-cumulative empirical and theoretical knowledge than the current paradigm -- and with far greater efficiency.},

  abstract = {Complexity---defined in terms of the number of components and the nature of the interdependencies between them---is clearly a relevant feature of all tasks that groups perform. Yet the role that task complexity plays in determining group performance remains poorly understood, in part because no clear language exists to express complexity in a way that allows for straightforward comparisons across tasks. Here we avoid this analytical difficulty by identifying a class of tasks for which complexity can be varied systematically while keeping all other elements of the task unchanged. We then test the effects of task complexity in a preregistered two-phase experiment in which 1,200 individuals were evaluated on a series of tasks of varying complexity (phase 1) and then randomly assigned to solve similar tasks either in interacting groups or as independent individuals (phase 2). We find that interacting groups are as fast as the fastest individual and more efficient than the most efficient individual for complex tasks but not for simpler ones. Leveraging our highly granular digital data, we define and precisely measure group process losses and synergistic gains and show that the balance between the two switches signs at intermediate values of task complexity. Finally, we find that interacting groups generate more solutions more rapidly and explore the solution space more broadly than independent problem solvers, finding higher-quality solutions than all but the highest-scoring individuals.},

This early work presents our initial efforts to leverage the recent advancements in Large Language Models (LLMs) to create usable and shareable energy datasets. In particular, we're utilising their mimicry of human behaviors, with the goal of extracting and exploring synthetic energy data through the simulation of LLM agents capable of interacting with and executing actions in controlled environments. We also analyse and visualise publicly available data in an attempt to create realistic but not quite exact copies of the originals. Our early results show some promise, with outputs that resemble the twin peak curves for household energy consumption. The hope is that our generalised approach can be used to easily replicate usable and realistic copies of otherwise secret or sensitive data.},

The novel system state penalty metrics are formulated based on piecewise linear functions of the system voltage and branch flow, guided by Weber's Law of human cognition. Novel continuous and discrete control action metrics are also developed to measure the inherent cost and risk associated with every action taken by human power system operator to resolve violations on a pre-contingent basis. These new metrics are combined with traditional human factors indices for measuring human-machine trust and cognitive workload to create a systematic framework for measuring and evaluating operator trust and reliance on artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms for control room use. An existing AIbased contingency analysis recommender tool using a semi-supervised action algorithm is selected for a series of experiments with operations engineering staff using the IEEE 118 Bus System. The penalty metrics presented are demonstrated for both steady-state contingency analysis and transient stability studies, with the operations participants able to reduce the total system penalty in 85\% of scenarios through remedial actions. A human-machine team was able to achieve equal or lower continuous control action penalty scores than the participant without availability of the recommender in 57\% of experiment scenarios and lower continuous control action penalty scores than the AI tool alone in 83\% of scenarios.},

The widespread shift to online discourse exacerbates many of these problems and corrodes the capacity of diverse societies to cooperate in solving social problems. Scholars and civil society groups promote interventions that make conversations less divisive or more productive, but scaling these efforts to online discourse is challenging. We conduct a large-scale experiment that demonstrates how online conversations about divisive topics can be improved with AI tools. Specifically, we employ a large language model to make real-time, evidence-based recommendations intended to improve participants' perception of feeling understood. These interventions improve reported conversation quality, promote democratic reciprocity, and improve the tone, without systematically changing the content of the conversation or moving people's policy attitudes.},

Practical and research applications of artificial intelligence tools have sometimes been limited by problematic biases (such as racism or sexism), which are often treated as uniform properties of the models. We show that the ``algorithmic bias'' within one such tool---the GPT-3 language model---is instead both fine-grained and demographically correlated, meaning that proper conditioning will cause it to accurately emulate response distributions from a wide variety of human subgroups. We term this property algorithmic fidelity and explore its extent in GPT-3. We create ``silicon samples'' by conditioning the model on thousands of sociodemographic backstories from real human participants in multiple large surveys conducted in the United States. We then compare the silicon and human samples to demonstrate that the information contained in GPT-3 goes far beyond surface similarity. It is nuanced, multifaceted, and reflects the complex interplay between ideas, attitudes, and sociocultural context that characterize human attitudes. We suggest that language models with sufficient algorithmic fidelity thus constitute a novel and powerful tool to advance understanding of humans and society across a variety of disciplines.},

Secondly, the architectures of present-day artificial intelligence algorithms are missing key features of the thalamocortical system that have been linked to conscious awareness in mammals. Finally, the evolutionary and developmental trajectories that led to the emergence of living conscious organisms arguably have no parallels in artificial systems as envisioned today. The existence of living organisms depends on their actions and their survival is intricately linked to multi-level cellular, inter-cellular, and organismal processes culminating in agency and consciousness.},

As legions of AI agents increasingly interact with each other and with humans, their ability to form shared conventions will determine how effectively they will coordinate behaviors, integrate into society and influence it. Here, we investigate the dynamics of conventions within populations of Large Language Model (LLM) agents using simulated interactions. First, we show that globally accepted social conventions can spontaneously arise from local interactions between communicating LLMs. Second, we demonstrate how strong collective biases can emerge during this process, even when individual agents appear to be unbiased. Third, we examine how minority groups of committed LLMs can drive social change by establishing new social conventions. We show that once these minority groups reach a critical size, they can consistently overturn established behaviors. In all cases, contrasting the experimental results with predictions from a minimal multi-agent model allows us to isolate the specific role of LLM agents. Our results clarify how AI systems can autonomously develop norms without explicit programming and have implications for designing AI systems that align with human values and societal goals.},

One area concerns the analytic capabilities and the information content of the decision aid, which focuses on (1) multiple goals and constraints, (2) hidden costs, and (3) heterogeneity in user characteristics. The other pertains to the framing so that users can easily process information through decision architecture by limiting choice overload and incorporating smart default options.},

In many cases, day-to-day navigation is embedded in a social context where cognition and behavior are shaped by others, but the great majority of existing research in spatial cognition has focused on individuals. The two studies we report here contribute to our understanding of social wayfinding, assessing the performance of paired and individual navigators on a real-world wayfinding task in which they were instructed to minimize time and distance traveled. In the first study, we recruited 30 pairs of friends (familiar dyads); in the second, we recruited 30 solo participants (individuals). We compare the two studies to the results of an earlier study of 30 pairs of strangers (unfamiliar dyads). We draw out differences in performance with respect to spatial, social, and cognitive considerations. Of the three conditions, solo participants were least successful in reaching the destination accurately on their initial attempt. Friends traveled more efficiently than either strangers or individuals. Working with a partner also appeared to lend confidence to wayfinders: dyads of either familiarity type were more persistent than individuals in the navigation task, even after encountering challenges or making incorrect attempts. Route selection was additionally impacted by route complexity and unfamiliarity with the study area. Navigators explicitly used ease of remembering as a planning criterion, and the resulting differences in route complexity likely influenced success during enacted navigation.},

In the second section of this article, I discuss the many limitations of Generative AI. I examine how bias in the data used to train these tools can negatively impact social science research---as well as a range of other challenges related to ethics, replication, environmental impact, and the proliferation of low-quality research. I conclude by arguing that social scientists can address many of these limitations by creating open-source infrastructure for research on human behavior. Such infrastructure is not only necessary to ensure broad access to high-quality research tools, I argue, but also because the progress of AI will require deeper understanding of the social forces that guide human behavior.},

A current development in histopathology is in the digitization of specimens by creating whole slide images (WSI) with slide scanners. Deep Learning Models (DLM) have been introduced to radiology or pathology for image recognition but dermatopathology lacks available solutions. Building on previous work about skin pathologies, this paper proposes a DLM following the U-Net architecture to detect AK in histopathological samples. In total, 297 histopathological slides (269 with AK and 28 without AK) have been retrospectively selected. They were randomly assigned to training, validation, and testing groups. Performance was evaluated by conducting a Case Control Accuracy Study on three levels of granularity. The DLM model achieved an overall accuracy of 99.13\% on the WSI level, 99.02\% on the patch level and an intersection over union (IoU) of 83.88\%. The proposed DLM reliably recognizes AK in histopathological images, supporting the implementation of DLMs in dermatopathology practice. Given existing technical capabilities and advancements, DLMs could have a significant influence on dermatopathology routine in the future.},

Mainstream approaches team up an expert with a machine learning model to which safer decisions are offloaded, thus letting the former focus on cases that demand their attention. his separation of responsibilities setup, however, is inadequate for high-stakes scenarios. On the one hand, the expert may end up over-relying on the machine's decisions due to anchoring bias, thus losing the human oversight that is increasingly being required by regulatory agencies to ensure trustworthy AI. On the other hand, the expert is left entirely unassisted on the (typically hardest) decisions on which the model abstained. As a remedy, we introduce learning to guide (LTG), an alternative framework in which - rather than taking control from the human expert - the machine provides guidance useful for decision making, and the human is entirely responsible for coming up with a decision. In order to ensure guidance is interpretable\vphantom\{\} and task-specific, we develop SLOG, an approach for turning any vision-language model into a capable generator of textual guidance by leveraging a modicum of human feedback. Our empirical evaluation highlights the promise of SLOG on a challenging, real-world medical diagnosis task.},

The analysis revealed that several variables in LinkedIn profiles were positively correlated with the amount of funds raised by startup companies establishing a link between social networks and entrepreneurial success. The average number of followers that the founders of a company had according to their LinkedIn profile was the strongest predictor of the amount of funds raised by companies.},

However, an exponential increase in new research findings is making the task of synthesizing ideas across the multitude of topics challenging, which could result in important overlooked research connections. In this research, we leverage the fact that social psychology research is based on verbal models and employ large natural language models to generate hypotheses that can aid social psychology researchers in developing new research hypotheses. We adopted two methodological approaches. In the first approach, we fine-tuned the third-generation generative pre-trained transformer (GPT-3) language model on thousands of abstracts published in more than 50 social psychology journals in the past 55 years as well as on preprint repositories (PsyArXiv). Social psychology experts rated model- and human-generated hypotheses similarly on the dimensions of clarity, originality, and impact. In the second approach, without fine-tuning, we generated hypotheses using GPT-4 and found that social psychology experts rated these generated hypotheses as higher in quality than human-generated hypotheses on dimensions of clarity, originality, impact, plausibility, and relevance.

Can explanations help lead to complementary performance, where team accuracy is higher than either the human or the AI working solo? We conduct mixed-method user studies on three datasets, where an AI with accuracy comparable to humans helps participants solve a task (explaining itself in some conditions). While we observed complementary improvements from AI augmentation, they were not increased by explanations. Rather, explanations increased the chance that humans will accept the AI's recommendation, regardless of its correctness. Our result poses new challenges for human-centered AI: Can we develop explanatory approaches that encourage appropriate trust in AI, and therefore help generate (or improve) complementary performance?},

As a prerequisite, to have the intended effects on energy saving behaviors, Alexa's emotional messages have to trigger three basic social cognitions: (1) the emotional display has to be identified by residents; (2) residents have to correctly identify their behavior as a target of the emotional display; and (3) residents have to attribute the emotional display to that behavior. In two studies (N = 194 and N = 353), several conditions were identified that triggered these three basic social cognitions in a simulated environment.},

  abstract = {In the last few years, Artificial Intelligence (AI) has achieved a notable momentum that, if harnessed appropriately, may deliver the best of expectations over many application sectors across the field. For this to occur shortly in Machine Learning, the entire community stands in front of the barrier of explainability, an inherent problem of the latest techniques brought by sub-symbolism (e.g. ensembles or Deep Neural Networks) that were not present in the last hype of AI (namely, expert systems and rule based models). Paradigms underlying this problem fall within the so-called eXplainable AI (XAI) field, which is widely acknowledged as a crucial feature for the practical deployment of AI models. The overview presented in this article examines the existing literature and contributions already done in the field of XAI, including a prospect toward what is yet to be reached. For this purpose we summarize previous efforts made to define explainability in Machine Learning, establishing a novel definition of explainable Machine Learning that covers such prior conceptual propositions with a major focus on the audience for which the explainability is sought. Departing from this definition, we propose and discuss about a taxonomy of recent contributions related to the explainability of different Machine Learning models, including those aimed at explaining Deep Learning methods for which a second dedicated taxonomy is built and examined in detail. This critical literature analysis serves as the motivating background for a series of challenges faced by XAI, such as the interesting crossroads of data fusion and explainability. Our prospects lead toward the concept of Responsible Artificial Intelligence, namely, a methodology for the large-scale implementation of AI methods in real organizations with fairness, model explainability and accountability at its core. Our ultimate goal is to provide newcomers to the field of XAI with a thorough taxonomy that can serve as reference material in order to stimulate future research advances, but also to encourage experts and professionals from other disciplines to embrace the benefits of AI in their activity sectors, without any prior bias for its lack of interpretability.},

This study evaluates the effectiveness of ChatGPT and the text-embedding-ada-002 (ADA) model in detecting post-traumatic stress disorder following childbirth (CB-PTSD), a maternal postpartum mental illness affecting millions of women annually, with no standard screening protocol. Using a sample of 1295 women who gave birth in the last six months and were 18+ years old, recruited through hospital announcements, social media, and professional organizations, we explore ChatGPT's and ADA's potential to screen for CB-PTSD by analyzing maternal childbirth narratives. The PTSD Checklist for DSM-5 (PCL-5; cutoff 31) was used to assess CB-PTSD. By developing an ML model that utilizes numerical vector representation of the ADA model, we identify CB-PTSD via narrative classification. Our model outperformed (F1 score: 0.81) ChatGPT and six previously published large text-embedding models trained on mental health or clinical domains data, suggesting that the ADA model can be harnessed to identify CB-PTSD. Our modeling approach could be generalized to assess other mental health disorders.},

Traditional post-hoc algorithms, while useful, often struggle to deliver interpretable explanations. Concept-based models offer a promising avenue by incorporating explicit representations of concepts to enhance interpretability. However, existing research on automatic concept discovery methods is often limited by lower-level concepts, costly human annotation requirements, and a restricted domain of background knowledge. In this study, we explore the potential of a Large Language Model (LLM), specifically GPT-4, by leveraging its domain knowledge and common-sense capability to generate high-level concepts that are meaningful as explanations for humans, for a specific setting of image classification. We use minimal textual object information available in the data via prompting to facilitate this process. To evaluate the output, we compare the concepts generated by the LLM with two other methods: concepts generated by humans and the ECII heuristic concept induction system. Since there is no established metric to determine the human understandability of concepts, we conducted a human study to assess the effectiveness of the LLM-generated concepts. Our findings indicate that while human-generated explanations remain superior, concepts derived from GPT-4 are more comprehensible to humans compared to those generated by ECII.},

  abstract = {Several ongoing research projects in Human autonomous car interactions are addressing the problem of safe co-existence for human and robot drivers on road. Automation in cars can vary across a continuum of levels at which it can replace manual tasks. Social relationships like anthropomorphic behavior of owners towards their cars is also expected to vary according to this spectrum of autonomous decision making capacity. Some researchers have proposed a joint cognitive model of a human-car collaboration that can make the best of the respective strengths of humans and machines. For a successful collaboration, it is important that the members of this humancar team develop, maintain and update each others behavioral models. We consider mutual trust as an integral part of these models. In this paper, we present a review of the quantitative models of trust in automation. We found that only a few models of humans' trust on automation exist in literature that account for the dynamic nature of trust and may be leveraged in human car interaction. However, these models do not support mutual trust. Our review suggests that there is significant scope for future research in the domain of mutual trust modeling for human car interaction, especially, when considered over the lifetime of the vehicle. Hardware and computational framework (for sensing, data aggregation, processing and modeling) must be developed to support these adaptive models over the operational phase of autonomous vehicles. In order to further research in mutual human - automation trust, we propose a framework for integrating Mutual Trust computation into standard Human - Robot Interaction research platforms. This framework includes User trust and Agent trust, the two fundamental components of Mutual trust. It allows us to harness multi-modal sensor data from the car as well as from the user's wearable or handheld device. The proposed framework provides access to prior trust aggregate and other cars' experience data from the Cloud and to feature primitives like gaze, facial expression, etc. from a standard low-cost Human - Robot Interaction platform.},

Decision aids constructed by this method were able to improve human decision-making. However, following the descriptions generated by this method is very tedious. We hypothesized that this problem can be overcome by conveying the automatically discovered decision strategy as a series of natural language instructions for how to reach a decision. Experiment~1 showed that people do indeed understand such procedural instructions more easily than the decision aids generated by our previous method. Encouraged by this finding, we developed an algorithm for translating the output of our previous method into procedural instructions. We applied the improved method to automatically generate decision aids for a naturalistic planning task (i.e., planning a road trip) and a naturalistic decision task (i.e., choosing a mortgage). Experiment~2 showed that these automatically generated decision aids significantly improved people's performance in planning a road trip and choosing a mortgage. These findings suggest that AI-powered boosting might have potential for improving human decision-making in the real world.},

In this paper we demonstrate how LLMs, such as OpenAI's ChatGPT 4 model, might be used to support the development of new psychometric scales. Partnering with AI for the purpose of developing and refining instruments, however, comes with its share of potential pitfalls. We thereby discuss throughout the paper that instrument development and refinement start and end with human judgment and expertise. We open with two use-cases that describe how we used LLMs in the development and refinement of two new psychological instruments. Next, we discuss possibilities for where and how researchers can use LLMs in the process of instrument development more broadly, including considerations for maximizing the benefits of LLMs and addressing the potential hazards when working with LLMs. Finally, we close by offering initial suggestions for psychology researchers interested in partnering with LLMs in this capacity.},

While prior work has established that there is population-level agreement in terms of how humans interpret these expressions, there has been little inquiry into the abilities of language models to interpret such expressions. In this paper, we investigate how language models map linguistic expressions of uncertainty to numerical responses. Our approach assesses whether language models can employ theory of mind in this setting: understanding the uncertainty of another agent about a particular statement, independently of the model's own certainty about that statement. We evaluate both humans and 10 popular language models on a task created to assess these abilities. Unexpectedly, we find that 8 out of 10 models are able to map uncertainty expressions to probabilistic responses in a human-like manner. However, we observe systematically different behavior depending on whether a statement is actually true or false. This sensitivity indicates that language models are substantially more susceptible to bias based on their prior knowledge (as compared to humans). These findings raise important questions and have broad implications for human-AI alignment and AI-AI communication.},

Furthermore, recreating existing figures that are not stored in formats preserving semantic information is equally complex. To tackle this problem, we introduce DeTikZify, a novel multimodal language model that automatically synthesizes scientific figures as semantics-preserving TikZ graphics programs based on sketches and existing figures. To achieve this, we create three new datasets: DaTikZv2, the largest TikZ dataset to date, containing over 360k human-created TikZ graphics; SketchFig, a dataset that pairs hand-drawn sketches with their corresponding scientific figures; and SciCap++, a collection of diverse scientific figures and associated metadata. We train DeTikZify on SciCap++ and DaTikZv2, along with synthetically generated sketches learned from SketchFig. We also introduce an MCTS-based inference algorithm that enables DeTikZify to iteratively refine its outputs without the need for additional training. Through both automatic and human evaluation, we demonstrate that DeTikZify outperforms commercial Claude 3 and GPT-4V in synthesizing TikZ programs, with the MCTS algorithm effectively boosting its performance. We make our code, models, and datasets publicly available.},

Teams conduct some safety-critical tasks to improve task performance and minimize the risk of error. These teams have traditionally consisted of human operators, yet, nowadays, artificial intelligence and machine systems are incorporated into team environments to improve performance and capacity. We used a computerized task modeled after a classic arcade game to investigate the performance of human--machine and human--human teams. We manipulated the group conditions between team members; sometimes, they were instructed to collaborate, compete, or work separately. We evaluated players' performance in the main task (gameplay) and, in post hoc analyses, participant behavioral patterns to inform group strategies. We compared game performance between team types (human--human vs. human--machine) and group conditions (competitive, collaborative, independent). Adapting workload capacity analysis to human--machine teams, we found performance under both team types and all group conditions suffered a performance efficiency cost. However, we observed a reduced cost in collaborative over competitive teams within human--human pairings, but this effect was diminished when playing with a machine partner. The implications of workload capacity analysis as a powerful tool for human--machine team performance measurement are discussed.},

Psychologists currently answer such questions with psychometric methods, which analyze correlations across participant responses in survey data sets. In this article, we analyze the preferences that give rise to these correlations. Our approach uses (a) large language models (LLMs) to quantify everyday risky behaviors in terms of the attributes or reasons that may describe those behaviors, and (b) decision models to map these attributes and reasons onto participant responses. We show that LLM-based decision models can explain observed correlations between behaviors in terms of the reasons different behaviors elicit and explain observed correlations between individuals in terms of the weights different individuals place on reasons, thereby providing a decision theoretic foundation for psychometric findings. Since LLMs can generate quantitative representations for nearly any naturalistic decision, they can be used to make accurate out-of-sample predictions for hundreds of everyday behaviors, predict the reasons why people may or may not want to engage in these behaviors, and interpret these reasons in terms of core psychological constructs. Our approach has important theoretical and practical implications for the study of heterogeneity in everyday behavior.},

Leading large language models (LLMs) go beyond toy problems but fail to mimic observed patterns of human induction. In this article, we combine rich knowledge representations obtained from LLMs with theories of human inductive reasoning developed by cognitive psychologists. We show that this integrative approach can capture several benchmark empirical findings on human induction and generate human-like responses to natural language arguments with thousands of common categories and properties. These findings shed light on the cognitive mechanisms at play in human induction and show how existing theories in psychology and cognitive science can be integrated with new methods in artificial intelligence, to successfully model highlevel human cognition.},

Using large language models (LLMs), we are able to extract hundreds of choice attributes at play in these problems and map them onto a common representational space. This representation allows us to quantify both the content (e.g. broader themes) and the structure (e.g. specific tradeoffs) inherent in everyday choices. We also present subsets of these decision problems to human participants, and find consistency in choice patterns, allowing us to predict naturalistic decisions with established decision models. Overall, our research provides new insights into the attributes, outcomes, and goals that underpin important life choices. In doing so, our work shows how LLM-based largescale structure extraction can be used to study real-world human behavior.},

While there have been previous attempts to instantiate such theories by building computational models, we currently do not have one model that captures the human mind in its entirety. Here we introduce Centaur, a computational model that can predict and simulate human behavior in any experiment expressible in natural language. We derived Centaur by finetuning a state-of-the-art language model on a novel, large-scale data set called Psych-101. Psych-101 reaches an unprecedented scale, covering trial-by-trial data from over 60,000 participants performing over 10,000,000 choices in 160 experiments. Centaur not only captures the behavior of held-out participants better than existing cognitive models, but also generalizes to new cover stories, structural task modifications, and entirely new domains. Furthermore, we find that the model's internal representations become more aligned with human neural activity after finetuning. Taken together, Centaur is the first real candidate for a unified model of human cognition. We anticipate that it will have a disruptive impact on the cognitive sciences, challenging the existing paradigm for developing computational models.},

In addition, we show that their representations contain the information necessary to model behavior on the level of individual subjects. Finally, we demonstrate that finetuning on multiple tasks enables large language models to predict human behavior in a previously unseen task.

We found that home upgrades occur typically as interconnected sets of projects. They are constituted of decision dilemmas between domestic space-making aspirations and technological choices, moderated by sentiments, opinions of peers, information, limiting factors and self-identities. Indoor upgrades are largely influenced by the functional and emotional goals of the household, whereas exterior and structurally complex upgrades are usually determined by parameters of the sociotechnical environment, including costs and available expertise. Behaviorally, functional needs and social situation of individuals are more influential to upgrade decisions than environmental values or ideological positions on decarbonization.},

  abstract = {For half a century, artificial intelligence research has attempted to reproduce the human qualities of abstraction and reasoning-creating computer systems that can learn new concepts from a minimal set of examples, in settings where humans find this easy. While specific neural networks are able to solve an impressive range of problems, broad generalisation to situations outside their training data has proved elusive. In this work, we look at several novel approaches for solving the Abstraction \& Reasoning Corpus (ARC). This is a dataset of abstract visual reasoning tasks introduced to test algorithms on broad generalization. Despite three international competitions with \$100,000 in prizes, the best algorithms still fail to solve a majority of ARC tasks. The best solvers today rely on complex hand-crafted rules, without using machine learning at all. We revisit whether recent advances in neural networks allow progress on this task, or whether an entirely different class of models are required. First, we adapt the DreamCoder Neurosymbolic reasoning solver to ARC. DreamCoder automatically writes programs in a bespoke domain-specific language to perform reasoning, using a neural network to mimic human intuition. We present the Perceptual Abstraction and Reasoning Language (PeARL) language, which allow DreamCoder to solve ARC tasks, and propose a new recognition model that allows us to significantly improve on the previous best implementation. We also propose a new encoding and augmentation scheme that allows large language models (LLMs) to solve ARC tasks, and find that the largest models can solve some ARC tasks. LLMs are able to solve a different group of problems to state-of-the-art solvers, and provide an interesting way to complement other approaches. We perform an ensemble analysis, combining models to achieve better results than any system alone. Finally, we publish the arckit Python library to make future research on ARC easier.},

The primary research question is to assess their classi{\dbend}cation accuracy and language generation capabilities to gain insights into their potential and limitations. Method: The methodology involves evaluating the models for the speci{\dbend}c task of scienti{\dbend}c paper screening.

Evaluation metrics such as accuracy and F1 scores are used, along with confusion matrices, to assess the models' classi{\dbend}cation performance. Results: The results show that the BERT model achieved the highest accuracy and F1 score among the tested models, while GPT-3 Turbo and 4 exhibited lower classi{\dbend}cation accuracy and F1 score performance. The processing speeds varied, with BERT bene{\dbend}ting from the CUDA framework. Each model provides, at best, twice as fast as a human coder processing speed of documents.

A second group of participants (``evaluators'') also answer general knowledge questions and decide who is more knowledgeable within pairs of informants, based on these descriptions.

Although discussions of transactive memory theory suggest that components of the theory are dynamic, research tends to treat transactive memory as evolving linearly, using static measures rather than assessing development over time. In response, we offer a model emphasizing both linear and cyclical aspects of transactive memory development in work groups, and we propose that task is a major influence on developmental processes. We introduce task representation and the task-expertise-person (TEP) unit as basic constructs involved in transactive memory development, and we provide a dynamic model of how TEP units are constructed, evaluated, and utilized. Regarding observable changes over time, we propose that transactive memory systems can vary in terms of accuracy (the degree to which group members' perceptions about others' task-related expertise are accurate), sharedness (the degree to which members have a shared representation of the transactive memory system), and validation (the degree to which group members participate in the transactive memory system). Convergence is the optimal state of transactive memory systems and reflects high levels of accuracy, sharedness, and validation.},

Human retellers, by contrast, reduce the original text incrementally and by creating 55--60\% of novel words and concepts (synsets) at each iteration. The retellings by both ChatGPT and humans show very stable emotion ratings, which is a puzzle for human retellers given the high degree of novel inventions across retellings. ChatGPT maintains more nouns, adjectives, and prepositions and also uses language later acquired in life, while humans use more verbs, adverbs, and negations and use language acquired at a younger age.

These systems pose risks to our information ecosystem: bias amplification, fabrication, and misinformation are some of the forecasted negative consequences of mass adoption of the technology. The recurring regulatory proposal to mitigate such risks is obligatory source disclosure. The underlying assumption is that if people know the origin of AI-generated language, they can exercise appropriate caution when engaging with it. Here we apply concepts from linguistics and cognitive science to ask what appropriate caution means when engaging with AI-generated linguistic content. We discuss an idealized model of human communication as a motivated activity aimed at increasing the mutually shared beliefs among conversation partners. Building on this model, we develop a set of conceptual tools and empirical signatures to evaluate whether humans engage with AI-generated linguistic messages in the same way as they would with a fellow human or if they approach it differently. Our preliminary empirical investigation implies that even when humans know that some language was generated by AI, they nevertheless treat it on par with human language, albeit with somewhat diminished trust. The main implication of this finding is that source disclosure is not a sufficient regulatory strategy to manage risks that will arise with the proliferation of synthetic language.},

Across scientific disciplines, most theoretical approaches that try to understand energy-related decisions and behaviors focus mainly on cognitive processes, such as computations of utility (typically economic), the impact of cognitive heuristics, or the role of individual beliefs. While these models already explain important aspects of human decisions and behavior in the energy domain, we argue that an additional consideration of the contributions of emotional processes may be very fruitful for a deeper understanding of the issue. In this contribution, we outline a theoretical perspective on energy-related decisions and behaviors that integrates emotions, elicited by a cognitive-affective appraisal of the relevance of a situation, into a response system driving adaptive decisions and behaviors. We empirically investigate the explanatory power of the model variables to predict intentions to reduce energy use demonstrating that the appraisal--emotion variables are able to account for additional variance that is not explained by two established models focused on cognitive processes (theory of planned behavior and value-belief-norm theory). Finally, we discuss how the appraisal--emotion approach may be fruitfully integrated with other existing approaches and outline some questions for future research.},

  abstract = {The meaning of most words in language depends on their context. Understanding how the human brain extracts contextualized meaning, and identifying where in the brain this takes place, remain important scientific challenges. But technological and computational advances in neuroscience and artificial intelligence now provide unprecedented opportunities to study the human brain in action as language is read and understood. Recent contextualized language models seem to be able to capture homonymic meaning variation (``bat'', in a baseball vs. a vampire context), as well as more nuanced differences of meaning---for example, polysemous words such as ``book'', which can be interpreted in distinct but related senses (``explain a book'', information, vs. ``open a book'', object) whose differences are fine-grained. We study these subtle differences in lexical meaning along the concrete/abstract dimension, as they are triggered by verb-noun semantic composition. We analyze functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) activations elicited by Italian verb phrases containing nouns whose interpretation is affected by the verb to different degrees. By using a contextualized language model and human concreteness ratings, we shed light on where in the brain such fine-grained meaning variation takes place and how it is coded. Our results show that phrase concreteness judgments and the contextualized model can predict BOLD activation associated with semantic composition within the language network. Importantly, representations derived from a complex, nonlinear composition process consistently outperform simpler composition approaches. This is compatible with a holistic view of semantic composition in the brain, where semantic representations are modified by the process of composition itself. When looking at individual brain areas, we find that encoding performance is statistically significant, although with differing patterns of results, suggesting differential involvement, in the posterior superior temporal sulcus, inferior frontal gyrus and anterior temporal lobe, and in motor areas previously associated with processing of concreteness/abstractness.},

Higher spatial anxiety was associated with more map viewing among group members, higher scores on questionnaires assessing autism-type traits were associated with lower group cohesion, higher group heterogeneity was associated with lower group cohesion and lower path efficiency, and triads tended to have poorer memory for the location of goal locations relative to individuals and dyads.

In Experiment 1, participants exhibited more flexibility following survey, compared to route, spatial descriptions. With extended study time, though, flexibility following route descriptions increased. In Experiment 2, complementary maps further enhanced flexibility for route-based descriptions. Interestingly, increased exposure to these maps actually reduced flexibility following survey descriptions.

Two experiments examined these possibilities while participants navigated virtual desktop environments, assessing information-seeking behavior (Experiment 1) and movement dynamics (Experiment 2) while approaching intersections. In Experiment 1, we found that participants requested navigation guidance while in path segments approaching an intersection and the guidance facilitated choice behavior. In Experiment 2, we found that participants tended to orient themselves toward an upcoming turn direction before entering an intersection, particularly as they became more familiar with the environment. Some of these patterns were modulated by individual differences in spatial ability, sense of direction, spatial strategies, and gender. Together, we provide novel evidence that deciding whether to continue straight or turn involves a dynamic, distributed decision-making process that is prompted by upcoming intersections and modulated by individual differences and environmental experience. We discuss implications of these results for spatial decision-making theory and the development of innovative adaptive, beacon-based navigation guidance systems.},

We argue this is partly because people intuitively seek contrastive explanations, which clarify the difference between the AI's decision and their own reasoning, while most AI systems offer "unilateral" explanations that justify the AI's decision but do not account for users' thinking. To align human-AI knowledge on decision tasks, we introduce a framework for generating human-centered contrastive explanations that explain the difference between AI's choice and a predicted, likely human choice about the same task. Results from a large-scale experiment (N = 628) demonstrate that contrastive explanations significantly enhance users' independent decision-making skills compared to unilateral explanations, without sacrificing decision accuracy. Amid rising deskilling concerns, our research demonstrates that incorporating human reasoning into AI design can foster human skill development.},

  abstract = {People supported by AI-powered decision support tools frequently overrely on the AI: they accept an AI's suggestion even when that suggestion is wrong. Adding explanations to the AI decisions does not appear to reduce the overreliance and some studies suggest that it might even increase it. Informed by the dual-process theory of cognition, we posit that people rarely engage analytically with each individual AI recommendation and explanation, and instead develop general heuristics about whether and when to follow the AI suggestions. Building on prior research on medical decision-making, we designed three cognitive forcing interventions to compel people to engage more thoughtfully with the AI-generated explanations. We conducted an experiment (N=199), in which we compared our three cognitive forcing designs to two simple explainable AI approaches and to a no-AI baseline. The results demonstrate that cognitive forcing significantly reduced overreliance compared to the simple explainable AI approaches. However, there was a trade-off: people assigned the least favorable subjective ratings to the designs that reduced the overreliance the most. To audit our work for intervention-generated inequalities, we investigated whether our interventions benefited equally people with different levels of Need for Cognition (i.e., motivation to engage in effortful mental activities). Our results show that, on average, cognitive forcing interventions benefited participants higher in Need for Cognition more. Our research suggests that human cognitive motivation moderates the effectiveness of explainable AI solutions.},

  abstract = {Building a theoretical understanding of the capabilities of large language models (LLMs) is vital for our ability to predict and explain the behavior of these systems. Here, we investigate the structure of LLM capabilities by extracting latent capabilities from patterns of individual differences across a varied population of LLMs. Using a combination of Bayesian and frequentist factor analysis, we analyzed data from 29 different LLMs across 27 cognitive tasks. We found evidence that LLM capabilities are not monolithic. Instead, they are better explained by three well-delineated factors that represent reasoning, comprehension and core language modeling. Moreover, we found that these three factors can explain a high proportion of the variance in model performance. These results reveal a consistent structure in the capabilities of different LLMs and demonstrate the multifaceted nature of these capabilities. We also found that the three abilities show different relationships to model properties such as model size and instruction tuning. These patterns help refine our understanding of scaling laws and indicate that changes to a model that improve one ability might simultaneously impair others. Based on these findings, we suggest that benchmarks could be streamlined by focusing on tasks that tap into each broad model ability.},

A keenly debated question here is whether social influence helps or hinders collective accuracy on estimation tasks, with recent results on the role of network structure hinting at a reconciliation of seemingly contradictory past results. Yet, despite a growing body of literature linking social network structure and collective accuracy, strategies for exploiting network structure to harness crowd wisdom are underexplored. We introduce one such strategy: rewiring algorithms that dynamically manipulate the structure of communicating social networks. Through agent-based simulations and an online multiplayer experiment, we provide a proof of concept showing how rewiring algorithms can increase the accuracy of collective estimations---even in the absence of knowledge of the ground truth. However, we also find that the algorithms' effects are contingent on the distribution of estimates initially held by individuals before communication occurs.

Researchers have asserted these models' limitations in the domains of causal reasoning, intuitive physics, and intuitive psychology. Yet recent advancements, namely the rise of large language models, particularly those designed for visual processing, have rekindled interest in the potential to emulate human-like cognitive abilities. This paper evaluates the current state of vision-based large language models in the domains of intuitive physics, causal reasoning, and intuitive psychology. Through a series of controlled experiments, we investigate the extent to which these modern models grasp complex physical interactions, causal relationships, and intuitive understanding of others' preferences. Our findings reveal that, while these models demonstrate a notable proficiency in processing and interpreting visual data, they still fall short of human capabilities in these areas. The models exhibit a rudimentary understanding of physical laws and causal relationships, but their performance is hindered by a lack of deeper insights-a key aspect of human cognition. Furthermore, in tasks requiring an intuitive theory of mind, the models fail altogether. Our results emphasize the need for integrating more robust mechanisms for understanding causality, physical dynamics, and social cognition into modern-day, vision-based language models, and point out the importance of cognitively-inspired benchmarks.},

We survey several prominent scientific theories of consciousness, including recurrent processing theory, global workspace theory, higher-order theories, predictive processing, and attention schema theory. From these theories we derive "indicator properties" of consciousness, elucidated in computational terms that allow us to assess AI systems for these properties. We use these indicator properties to assess several recent AI systems, and we discuss how future systems might implement them. Our analysis suggests that no current AI systems are conscious, but also suggests that there are no obvious technical barriers to building AI systems which satisfy these indicators.},

We define three citation-recommendation tasks. We also collect and annotate a dataset of model-recommended citations for those tasks. We find that GPT-4 largely outperforms earlier models on both author and title accuracy in two markedly different CS venues, but may not recommend references that are more relevant than those recommended by the earlier models. The two venues we compare are CHI and EMNLP. All models appear to perform better at recommending EMNLP papers than CHI papers.},

Previous research has found that such errors can be partly prevented by teaching people decision strategies that would allow them to make better choices in specific situations. Three bottlenecks of this approach are our limited knowledge of effective decision strategies, the limited transfer of learning beyond the trained task, and the challenge of efficiently teaching good decision strategies to a large number of people. We introduce a general approach to solving these problems that leverages artificial intelligence to discover and teach optimal decision strategies. As a proof of concept, we developed an intelligent tutor that teaches people the automatically discovered optimal heuristic for environments where immediate rewards do not predict long-term outcomes. We found that practice with our intelligent tutor was more effective than conventional approaches to improving human decision making. The benefits of training with our cognitive tutor transferred to a more challenging task and were retained over time. Our general approach to improving human decision making by developing intelligent tutors also proved successful for another environment with a very different reward structure. These findings suggest that leveraging artificial intelligence to discover and teach optimal cognitive strategies is a promising approach to improving human judgment and decision making.},

In Experiment 1, we find that a resource-rational planning strategy predicts the process by which people plan more accurately than previous models of planning. Furthermore, in Experiment 2, we find that it also captures how people's planning strategies adapt to the structure of the environment.

Large language models (LLMs) can offer creative and viable solutions to enable a practical and user-acceptable interpretation of such ambiguous commands. This paper introduces an interactive disambiguation approach that integrates visual and textual cues with natural language commands. After contextualizing the approach with a use case, we test it in an experiment where users are prompted to select the appropriate cue (an image or a textual description) to clarify ambiguous commands, thereby refining the accuracy of the system's interpretations. Outcomes from the study indicate that the disambiguation system produces responses well-aligned with user intentions, and that participants found the textual descriptions slightly more effective. Finally, interviews reveal heightened satisfaction with the smart-home system when engaging with the proposed disambiguation approach.},

To better understand this puzzling pattern of successes and failures, we turn to theoretical accounts of the binding problem in cognitive science and neuroscience, a fundamental problem that arises when a shared set of representational resources must be used to represent distinct entities (e.g., to represent multiple objects in an image), necessitating the use of serial processing to avoid interference. We find that many of the puzzling failures of state-of-the-art VLMs can be explained as arising due to the binding problem, and that these failure modes are strikingly similar to the limitations exhibited by rapid, feedforward processing in the human brain.},

However, quantitative communications about electricity use may be difficult to understand, especially for consumers with low energy literacy. Here, we build on the health communication and graph comprehension literature to inform electricity bill design, with the goal of improving understanding, preferences for the presented communication, and intentions to save electricity. In a survey-based experiment, each participant saw a hypothetical electricity bill for a family with relatively high electricity use, covering information about (a) historical use, (b) comparisons to neighbors, and (c) historical use with appliance breakdown. Participants saw all information types in one of three formats including (a) tables, (b) bar graphs, and (c) icon graphs. We report on three main findings. First, consumers understood each type of electricity-use information the most when it was presented in a table, perhaps because tables facilitate simple point reading. Second, preferences and intentions to save electricity were the strongest for the historical use information, independent of format. Third, individuals with lower energy literacy understood all information less. We discuss implications for designing utility bills that are understandable, perceived as useful, and motivate consumers to save energy.},

We performed online memory experiments with a large number of participants and collected recognition and recall data for narratives of different lengths. We found that both recall and recognition performance scale linearly with narrative length. Furthermore, in order to investigate the role of narrative comprehension in memory, we repeated these experiments using scrambled versions of the presented stories. We found that even though recall performance declined significantly, recognition remained largely unaffected. Interestingly, recalls in this condition seem to follow the original narrative order rather than the scrambled presentation, pointing to a contextual reconstruction of the story in memory.},

The models' accuracy ranged from r\,=\,.78 to .88 without controls and from r\,=\,.53 to .70 when controlling for public figures' likability and demographics, after correcting for attenuation. Prediction models showed high face validity as revealed by the personality-descriptive adjectives occupying their extremes. Our findings reveal that GPT-3 word embeddings capture signals pertaining to individual differences and intimate traits.},

  abstract = {Visual Reasoning AVR is often used to determine human intelligence related to visual cognition and working memory [31, 32, 33]. Matrix reasoning and compositional visual relation reasoning are two of the most representative AVR problems that are widely used by RPM [7, 34], WISC [6, 35] to evaluate human's ability to detect the underlying conceptual relationship among visual objects and use reasoning to find visual cues. Early research indicated that deep learning models can be trained with large-scale AVR datasets to solve simple matrix reasoning [36, 13, 4, 37, 38] and compositional visual relation tasks [33, 20, 39, 40], achieving human-level accuracy. Several datasets and benchmarks are also proposed, such as PGM [9], RAVEN [10], RAVEN-I [12], RAVENFAIR [41], CVR [20]. However, these works have a key limitation. They ignore that humans can solve these problems by zero-shot reasoning without explicitly learning from large-scale data. After the blooming of LLMs, researchers are keen on testing whether LLMs reached the same abstract reasoning capabilities as humans. Webb et al. [24] encode matrix reasoning into a symbolic problem based on human's prior and validate LLM can understand this task. Recently, there are also some useful zero-shot visual reasoning inference datasets containing AVR samples have been proposed in the AI/ML community, such as RAVEN-IQ [16] containing 50 instances, Visual Reasoning Benchmark [42] containing 241 instances in total, and ConceptARC [43] containing 480 instances but all of them are limited by lacking rigorous human experiments as reference and conducting experiments on relatively small datasets without psychometrical validation.},

  abstract = {Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has the potential to both exacerbate and ameliorate existing socioeconomic inequalities. In this article, we provide a state-of-the-art interdisciplinary overview of the potential impacts of generative AI on (mis)information and three information-intensive domains: work, education, and healthcare. Our goal is to highlight how generative AI could worsen existing inequalities while illuminating how AI may help mitigate pervasive social problems. In the information domain, generative AI can democratize content creation and access but may dramatically expand the production and proliferation of misinformation. In the workplace, it can boost productivity and create new jobs, but the benefits will likely be distributed unevenly. In education, it offers personalized learning, but may widen the digital divide. In healthcare, it might improve diagnostics and accessibility, but could deepen pre-existing inequalities. In each section, we cover a specific topic, evaluate existing research, identify critical gaps, and recommend research directions, including explicit trade-offs that complicate the derivation of a priori hypotheses. We conclude with a section highlighting the role of policymaking to maximize generative AI's potential to reduce inequalities while mitigating its harmful effects. We discuss strengths and weaknesses of existing policy frameworks in the European Union, the United States, and the United Kingdom, observing that each fails to fully confront the socioeconomic challenges we have identified. We propose several concrete policies that could promote shared prosperity through the advancement of generative AI. This article emphasizes the need for interdisciplinary collaborations to understand and address the complex challenges of generative AI.},

This is undesirable because memorization violates privacy (exposing user data), degrades utility (repeated easy-to-memorize text is often low quality), and hurts fairness (some texts are memorized over others). We describe three log-linear relationships that quantify the degree to which LMs emit memorized training data. Memorization significantly grows as we increase (1) the capacity of a model, (2) the number of times an example has been duplicated, and (3) the number of tokens of context used to prompt the model. Surprisingly, we find the situation becomes more complicated when generalizing these results across model families. On the whole, we find that memorization in LMs is more prevalent than previously believed and will likely get worse as models continues to scale, at least without active mitigations.},

However, the labor-intensive effort required to manually assess students' explanations makes it impractical for classroom settings. As a result, many current solutions to gauge students' understanding during class are often limited to multiple choice or fill-in-the-blank questions, which are less effective at exposing misconceptions or helping students to understand and integrate new concepts. Recent advances in large language models (LLMs) present an opportunity to assess student explanations in real-time, making explanation-based classroom response systems feasible for implementation. In this work, we investigate LLM-based approaches for assessing the correctness of students' explanations in response to undergraduate computer science questions. We investigate alternative prompting approaches for multiple LLMs (i.e., Llama 2, GPT-3.5, and GPT-4) and compare their performance to FLAN-T5 models trained in a fine-tuning manner. The results suggest that the highest accuracy and weighted F1 score were achieved by fine-tuning FLAN-T5, while an in-context learning approach with GPT-4 attains the highest macro F1 score.},

Agents that assume their partner to be optimal or similar to them can converge to coordination protocols that fail to understand and be understood by humans. To demonstrate this, we introduce a simple environment that requires challenging coordination, based on the popular game Overcooked, and learn a simple model that mimics human play. We evaluate the performance of agents trained via self-play and population-based training. These agents perform very well when paired with themselves, but when paired with our human model, they are significantly worse than agents designed to play with the human model. An experiment with a planning algorithm yields the same conclusion, though only when the human-aware planner is given the exact human model that it is playing with. A user study with real humans shows this pattern as well, though less strongly. Qualitatively, we find that the gains come from having the agent adapt to the human's gameplay. Given this result, we suggest several approaches for designing agents that learn about humans in order to better coordinate with them.

Increasingly, AI tools are considered as a solution to foster deliberative discourse. Against the backdrop of previous research, we show that AI tools for online discussions heavily focus on the deliberative norms of rationality and civility. In the operationalization of those norms for AI tools, the complex deliberative dimensions are simplified, and the focus lies on the detection of argumentative structures in argument mining or verbal markers of supposedly uncivil comments. If the fairness of such tools is considered, the focus lies on data bias and an input--output frame of the problem. We argue that looking beyond bias and analyzing such applications through a sociotechnical frame reveals how they interact with social hierarchies and inequalities, reproducing patterns of exclusion. The current focus on verbal markers of incivility and argument mining risks excluding minority voices and privileges those who have more access to education. Finally, we present a normative argument why examining AI tools for online discourses through a sociotechnical frame is ethically preferable, as ignoring the predicable negative effects we describe would present a form of objectionable indifference.},

  abstract = {Computational models of semantic representations have long assumed and produced a single static representation for each word type, ignoring the influence of linguistic context on semantic representations. Recent Large Language Models (LLMs) introduced in Natural Language Processing, however, learn token-level contextualised representations, holding promise to study how semantic representations change in different contexts. In this study we probe type- and token-level representations learned using a prominent example of such models, Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers (BERT), for their ability to i) explain semantic effects found for isolated words (semantic relatedness and similarity ratings, lexical decision, and semantic priming), but critically also to ii) exhibit systematic interactions between lexical semantics and context, and iii) explain meaning modulations in context. Across a wide range of empirical studies on each of these topics, we show that BERT representations satisfy two desiderata for psychologically valid semantic representations: i) they have a stable semantic core which allows people to interpret words in isolation and prevents words to be used arbitrarily and ii) they interact with sentence context in systematic ways, with representations shifting as a function of their semantic core and the context. This demonstrates that a single, comprehensive model which simultaneously learns abstract, type-level prototype representations as well as mechanisms of how these interact with context can explain both isolated word effects and context-dependent variations. Notably, these variations are not limited to discrete word senses, eschewing a strict dichotomy between exemplar and prototype models and re-framing traditional notions of polysemy.},

These models have no grounded understanding of the meanings of words at all; they simply learn to predict words based on the surrounding context provided by other words. Yet, our analyses show that their representations capture fine-grained meaningful distinctions between unambiguous, homonymous, and polysemous words that align with lexicographic classifications and psychological theorising.

  abstract = {Computational rationality explains human behavior as arising due to the maximization of expected utility under the constraints imposed by the environment and limited cognitive resources. This simple assumption, when instantiated via partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs), gives rise to a powerful approach for modeling human adaptive behavior, within which a variety of internal models of cognition can be embedded. In particular, such an instantiation enables the use of methods from reinforcement learning (RL) to approximate the optimal policy solution to the sequential decision-making problems posed to the cognitive system in any given setting; this stands in contrast to requiring ad hoc hand-crafted rules for capturing adaptive behavior in more traditional cognitive architectures. However, despite their successes and promise for modeling human adaptive behavior across everyday tasks, computationally rational models that use RL are not easy to build. Being a hybrid of theoretical cognitive models and machine learning (ML) necessitates that model building take into account appropriate practices from both cognitive science and ML. The design of psychological assumptions and machine learning decisions concerning reward specification, policy optimization, parameter inference, and model selection are all tangled processes rife with pitfalls that can hinder the development of valid and effective models. Drawing from a decade of work on this approach, a workflow is outlined for tackling this challenge and is accompanied by a detailed discussion of the pros and cons at key decision points.},

We quantify the final surprisal, within-run variability, age of acquisition, forgettability, and cross-run variability of learning curves for individual tokens in context. More frequent tokens reach lower final surprisals, exhibit less variability within and across pre-training runs, are learned earlier, and are less likely to be "forgotten" during pre-training. Higher n-gram probabilities further accentuate these effects. Independent of the target token, shorter and more frequent contexts correlate with marginally more stable and quickly acquired predictions. Effects of part-of-speech are also small, although nouns tend to be acquired later and less stably than verbs, adverbs, and adjectives.

Prior approaches either involve deep learning models, which require many observed networks for training, or stylized models, which are limited in their realism and flexibility. In contrast, LLMs offer the potential for zero-shot and flexible network generation. However, two key questions are: (1) are LLM's generated networks realistic, and (2) what are risks of bias, given the importance of demographics in forming social ties? To answer these questions, we develop three prompting methods for network generation and compare the generated networks to real social networks. We find that more realistic networks are generated with "local" methods, where the LLM constructs relations for one persona at a time, compared to "global" methods that construct the entire network at once. We also find that the generated networks match real networks on many characteristics, including density, clustering, community structure, and degree. However, we find that LLMs emphasize political homophily over all other types of homophily and overestimate political homophily relative to real-world measures.},

By showcasing Persona Hub's use cases in synthesizing high-quality mathematical and logical reasoning problems, instructions (i.e., user prompts), knowledge-rich texts, game NPCs and tools (functions) at scale, we demonstrate persona-driven data synthesis is versatile, scalable, flexible, and easy to use, potentially driving a paradigm shift in synthetic data creation and applications in practice, which may have a profound impact on LLM research and development.},

  abstract = {Transformer models can use two fundamentally different kinds of information: information stored in weights during training, and information provided ``in-context'' at inference time. In this work, we show that transformers exhibit different inductive biases in how they represent and generalize from the information in these two sources. In particular, we characterize whether they generalize via parsimonious rules (rule-based generalization) or via direct comparison with observed examples (exemplar-based generalization). This is of important practical consequence, as it informs whether to encode information in weights or in context, depending on how we want models to use that information. In transformers trained on controlled stimuli, we find that generalization from weights is more rule-based whereas generalization from context is largely exemplar-based. In contrast, we find that in transformers pre-trained on natural language, in-context learning is significantly rule-based, with larger models showing more rule-basedness. We hypothesise that rule-based generalization from in-context information might be an emergent consequence of large-scale training on language, which has sparse rule-like structure. Using controlled stimuli, we verify that transformers pretrained on data containing sparse rule-like structure exhibit more rule-based generalization.},

We also demonstrate that two-set training - repeated use of a small random subset of examples, along normal sampling on the rest of the training set - provides for faster learning and better performance. This highlights that the benefits of repetition can outweigh those of data diversity.

A fundamental research question is: will LLM-generated misinformation cause more harm than human-written misinformation? We propose to tackle this question from the perspective of detection difficulty. We first build a taxonomy of LLM-generated misinformation. Then we categorize and validate the potential real-world methods for generating misinformation with LLMs. Then, through extensive empirical investigation, we discover that LLM-generated misinformation can be harder to detect for humans and detectors compared to human-written misinformation with the same semantics, which suggests it can have more deceptive styles and potentially cause more harm. We also discuss the implications of our discovery on combating misinformation in the age of LLMs and the countermeasures.},

This paper examines the economic rationality of GPT by instructing it to make budgetary decisions in four domains: risk, time, social, and food preferences. We measure economic rationality by assessing the consistency of GPT's decisions with utility maximization in classic revealed preference theory. We find that GPT's decisions are largely rational in each domain and demonstrate higher rationality score than those of human subjects in a parallel experiment and in the literature. Moreover, the estimated preference parameters of GPT are slightly different from human subjects and exhibit a lower degree of heterogeneity. We also find that the rationality scores are robust to the degree of randomness and demographic settings such as age and gender but are sensitive to contexts based on the language frames of the choice situations. These results suggest the potential of LLMs to make good decisions and the need to further understand their capabilities, limitations, and underlying mechanisms.},

However, these models still face challenges in medical multimodal capabilities due to limitations in the quantity and quality of medical vision-text data, stemming from data privacy concerns and high annotation costs. While pioneering approaches utilize PubMed's large-scale, de-identified medical image-text pairs to address these limitations, they still fall short due to inherent data noise. To tackle this, we refined medical image-text pairs from PubMed and employed MLLMs (GPT-4V) in an 'unblinded' capacity to denoise and reformat the data, resulting in the creation of the PubMedVision dataset with 1.3 million medical VQA samples. Our validation demonstrates that: (1) PubMedVision can significantly enhance the medical multimodal capabilities of current MLLMs, showing significant improvement in benchmarks including the MMMU Health \& Medicine track; (2) manual checks by medical experts and empirical results validate the superior data quality of our dataset compared to other data construction methods. Using PubMedVision, we train a 34B medical MLLM HuatuoGPT-Vision, which shows superior performance in medical multimodal scenarios among open-source MLLMs.},

  abstract = {Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) have gained significant attention recently, showing remarkable potential in artificial general intelligence. However, assessing the utility of MLLMs presents considerable challenges, primarily due to the absence of multimodal benchmarks that align with human preferences. Drawing inspiration from the concept of LLM-as-a-Judge within LLMs, this paper introduces a novel benchmark, termed MLLM-as-a-Judge, to assess the ability of MLLMs in assisting judges across diverse modalities, encompassing three distinct tasks: Scoring Evaluation, Pair Comparison, and Batch Ranking. Our study reveals that, while MLLMs demonstrate remarkable human-like discernment in Pair Comparison, there is a significant divergence from human preferences in Scoring Evaluation and Batch Ranking. Furthermore, a closer examination reveals persistent challenges in the judgment capacities of LLMs, including diverse biases, hallucinatory responses, and inconsistencies in judgment, even in advanced models such as GPT-4V. These findings emphasize the pressing need for enhancements and further research efforts to be undertaken before regarding MLLMs as fully reliable evaluators. In light of this, we advocate for additional efforts dedicated to supporting the continuous development within the domain of MLLM functioning as judges.

  abstract = {Understanding and reasoning about spatial relationships is a fundamental capability for Visual Question Answering (VQA) and robotics. While Vision Language Models (VLM) have demonstrated remarkable performance in certain VQA benchmarks, they still lack capabilities in 3D spatial reasoning, such as recognizing quantitative relationships of physical objects like distances or size differences. We hypothesize that VLMs' limited spatial reasoning capability is due to the lack of 3D spatial knowledge in training data and aim to solve this problem by training VLMs with Internet-scale spatial reasoning data. To this end, we present a system to facilitate this approach. We first develop an automatic 3D spatial VQA data generation framework that scales up to 2 billion VQA examples on 10 million real-world images. We then investigate various factors in the training recipe, including data quality, training pipeline, and VLM architecture. Our work features the first internet-scale 3D spatial reasoning dataset in metric space. By training a VLM on such data, we significantly enhance its ability on both qualitative and quantitative spatial VQA. Finally, we demonstrate that this VLM unlocks novel downstream applications in chain-of-thought spatial reasoning and robotics due to its quantitative estimation capability.

  abstract = {LLMs are being set loose in complex, real-world environments involving sequential decision-making and tool use. Often, this involves making choices on behalf of human users. Not much is known about the distribution of such choices, and how susceptible they are to different choice architectures. We perform a case study with a few such LLM models on a multi-attribute tabular decision-making problem, under the canonical default option nudge and additional prompting strategies. We show that, despite superficial similarities to human choice distributions, such models differ in subtle but important ways. First, they show much higher susceptibility to the default option nudge. Second, they diverge in points earned, being affected by factors like the idiosyncrasy of available prizes. Third, they diverge in information acquisition strategies: e.g. incurring substantial cost to reveal too much information, or selecting without revealing any. Finally, we show that simple prompt nudges like self-explanations can shift the choice distribution, and few-shot prompting with human data can induce greater alignment. These findings suggest that more information is needed before deploying models as agents or assistants acting on behalf of users in complex environments.},

Some researchers even propose using LLMs as participants in psychology experiments. It is therefore important to understand how well LLMs make moral decisions and how they compare to humans. We investigated this question in realistic moral dilemmas using prompts where GPT-4, Llama 3, and Claude 3 give advice and where they emulate a research participant. In Study 1, we compared responses from LLMs to a representative US sample (N = 285) for 22 dilemmas: social dilemmas that pitted self-interest against the greater good, and moral dilemmas that pitted utilitarian cost-benefit reasoning against deontological rules. In social dilemmas, LLMs were more altruistic than participants. In moral dilemmas, LLMs exhibited stronger omission bias than participants: they usually endorsed inaction over action. In Study 2 (N = 490, preregistered), we replicated this omission bias and document an additional bias: unlike humans, LLMs (except GPT-4o) tended to answer ``no'' in moral dilemmas, whereby the phrasing of the question influences the decision even when physical action remains the same. Our findings show that LLM moral decision-making amplifies human biases and introduces potentially problematic biases.},

TUTOREVAL helps measure real-life usability of LMs as scientific assistants, and it is the first benchmark combining long contexts, free-form generation, and multidisciplinary scientific knowledge. Moreover, we show that fine-tuning base models with existing dialogue datasets leads to poor performance on TUTOREVAL. Therefore, we create TUTORCHAT, a dataset of 80,000 long synthetic dialogues about textbooks. We use TUTORCHAT to fine-tune Llemma models with 7B and 34B parameters. These LM tutors specialized in math have a 32K-token context window, and they excel at TUTOREVAL while performing strongly on GSM8K and MATH.

Inspired by the exceptional conversational capabilities ex- hibited by modern large language models (LLMs), we design four different styles of devil's advocate powered by LLMs, varying their interactivity (i.e., interactive vs. non-interactive) and their target of objection (i.e., challenge the AI recommendation or the majority opinion within the group). Through a randomized human-subject experiment, we find evidence suggesting that LLM-powered devil's advocates that argue against the AI model's decision recommenda- tion have the potential to promote groups' appropriate reliance on AI. Meanwhile, the introduction of LLM-powered devil's advocate usually does not lead to substantial increases in people's perceived workload for completing the group decision making tasks, while interactive LLM-powered devil's advocates are perceived as more collaborating and of higher quality.

While some work has found that the surprisal estimates from these models can be used to predict a wide range of human neural and behavioral responses, other work studying more complex syntactic phenomena has found that these surprisal estimates generate incorrect behavioral predictions. This paper explores the extent to which the misalignment between empirical and model-predicted behavior can be minimized by training models on more developmentally plausible data, such as in the BabyLM Challenge. We trained teacher language models on the BabyLM "strict-small" dataset and used sentence level surprisal estimates from these teacher models to create a curriculum. We found tentative evidence that our curriculum made it easier for models to acquire linguistic knowledge from the training data: on the subset of tasks in the BabyLM challenge suite evaluating models' grammatical knowledge of English, models first trained on the BabyLM data curriculum and then on a few randomly ordered training epochs performed slightly better than models trained on randomly ordered epochs alone. This improved linguistic knowledge acquisition did not result in better alignment with human reading behavior, however: models trained on the BabyLM dataset (with or without a curriculum) generated predictions that were as misaligned with human behavior as models trained on larger less curated datasets. This suggests that training on developmentally plausible datasets alone is likely insufficient to generate language models capable of accurately predicting human language processing.},

These complex charts are prevalent in everyday life, and individuals who lack knowledge in data visualization may find them challenging to understand. This paper investigates using Large Language Models (LLMs) to help users with low data literacy understand complex visualizations. While previous studies focus on text interactions with users, we noticed that visual cues are also critical for interpreting charts. We introduce an LLM application that supports both text and visual interaction for guiding chart interpretation. Our study with 26 participants revealed that the in-situ support effectively assisted users in interpreting charts and enhanced learning by addressing specific chart-related questions and encouraging further exploration. Visual communication allowed participants to convey their interests straightforwardly, eliminating the need for textual descriptions. However, the LLM assistance led users to engage less with the system, resulting in fewer insights from the visualizations. This suggests that users, particularly those with lower data literacy and motivation, may have over-relied on the LLM agent. We discuss opportunities for deploying LLMs to enhance visualization literacy while emphasizing the need for a balanced approach.},

This paper investigates the efficiency and accuracy of LLMs in specialized tasks through a structured user study focusing on Human-LLM partnership. The study, conducted in two stages-Topic Discovery and Topic Assignment-integrates LLMs with expert annotators to observe the impact of LLM suggestions on what is usually human-only analysis. Results indicate that LLM-generated topic lists have significant overlap with human generated topic lists, with minor hiccups in missing document-specific topics. However, LLM suggestions may significantly improve task completion speed, but at the same time introduce anchoring bias, potentially affecting the depth and nuance of the analysis, raising a critical question about the trade-off between increased efficiency and the risk of biased analysis.},

This study assessed whether LLM alignment with human behavior can be improved by integrating information from empirically-derived human belief networks. Using data from a human survey, we estimated a belief network encompassing 18 topics loading on two non-overlapping latent factors. We then seeded LLM-based agents with an opinion on one topic, and assessed the alignment of its expressed opinions on remaining test topics with corresponding human data. Role-playing based on demographic information alone did not align LLM and human opinions, but seeding the agent with a single belief greatly improved alignment for topics related in the belief network, and not for topics outside the network. These results suggest a novel path for human-LLM belief alignment in work seeking to simulate and understand patterns of belief distributions in society.},

Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to simulate human collective behavior, yet few benchmarks exist for evaluating their dynamics against the behavior of human groups. In this paper, we examine the extent to which the wisdom of partisan crowds emerges in groups of LLM-based agents that are prompted to role-play as partisan personas (e.g., Democrat or Republican). We find that they not only display human-like partisan biases, but also converge to more accurate beliefs through deliberation, as humans do. We then identify several factors that interfere with convergence, including the use of chain-of-thought prompting and lack of details in personas. Conversely, fine-tuning on human data appears to enhance convergence. These findings show the potential and limitations of LLM-based agents as a model of human collective intelligence.},

  abstract = {We study the evolution of opinions inside a population of interacting large language models (LLMs). Every LLM needs to decide how much funding to allocate to an item with three initial possibilities: full, partial, or no funding. We identify biases that drive the exchange of opinions based on the LLM's tendency to (i) find consensus with the other LLM's opinion, (ii) display caution when specifying funding, and (iii) consider ethical concerns in its opinion. We find these biases are affected by the perceived absence of compelling reasons for opinion change, the perceived willingness to engage in discussion, and the distribution of allocation values. Moreover, tensions among biases can lead to the survival of funding for items with negative connotations. We also find that the final distribution of full, partial, and no funding opinions is more diverse when an LLM freely forms its opinion after an interaction than when its opinion is a multiple-choice selection among the three allocation options. In the latter case, consensus or polarization is generally attained. When agents are aware of past opinions, they seek to maintain consistency with them, and more diverse updating rules emerge. Our study is performed using a Llama 3 LLM.},

Recently, several studies proved that Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively capture common-sense knowledge about human activities. However, the effectiveness of LLMs for ADLs recognition in smart home environments still deserves to be investigated. In this work, we propose ADL-LLM, a novel LLM-based ADLs recognition system. ADLLLM transforms raw sensor data into textual representations, that are processed by an LLM to perform zero-shot ADLs recognition. Moreover, in the scenario where a small labeled dataset is available, ADL-LLM can also be empowered with few-shot prompting. We evaluated ADL-LLM on two public datasets, showing its effectiveness in this domain.},

This novel approach offers a toolkit for phenotyping LLMs' behavior. We apply CogBench to 35 LLMs, yielding a rich and diverse dataset. We analyze this data using statistical multilevel modeling techniques, accounting for the nested dependencies among fine-tuned versions of specific LLMs. Our study highlights the crucial role of model size and reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) in improving performance and aligning with human behavior. Interestingly, we find that open-source models are less risk-prone than proprietary models and that fine-tuning on code does not necessarily enhance LLMs' behavior. Finally, we explore the effects of prompt-engineering techniques. We discover that chain-of-thought prompting improves probabilistic reasoning, while take-a-step-back prompting fosters model-based behaviors.},

Further, we identify useful scenarios and existing issues of GPT-4 in mathematical reasoning through a series of case studies contributed by expert mathematicians. We conclude with actionable takeaways for ML practitioners and mathematicians: models which communicate uncertainty, respond well to user corrections, are more interpretable and concise may constitute better assistants; interactive evaluation is a promising way to continually navigate the capability of these models; humans should be aware of language models' algebraic fallibility, and for that reason discern where they should be used.},

Despite impressive capabilities, over-consumption of language model outputs risks propagating unchecked errors in the short-term and damaging human capabilities for critical thinking in the long-term, particularly in knowledge-based tasks. How can we develop scaffolding around language models to curate more appropriate use? We propose selective frictions for language model experiences, inspired by behavioral science interventions, to dampen misuse. Frictions involve small modifications to a user's experience, e.g., the addition of a button impeding model access and reminding a user of their expertise relative to the model. Through a user study with real humans, we observe shifts in user behavior from the imposition of a friction over LLMs in the context of a multi-topic question-answering task as a representative task that people may use LLMs for, e.g., in education and information retrieval. We find that frictions modulate over-reliance by driving down users' click rates while minimally affecting accuracy for those topics. Yet, frictions may have unintended effects. We find marked differences in users' click behaviors even on topics where frictions were not provisioned. Our contributions motivate further study of human-AI behavioral interaction to inform more effective and appropriate LLM use.},

This paper investigates the effectiveness of fine-grained feedback which captures nuanced distinctions in image quality and prompt-alignment, compared to traditional coarsegrained feedback (for example, thumbs up/down or ranking between a set of options). While fine-grained feedback holds promise, particularly for systems catering to diverse societal preferences, we show that demonstrating its superiority to coarse-grained feedback is not automatic. Through experiments on real and synthetic preference data, we surface the complexities of building effective models due to the interplay of model choice, feedback type, and the alignment between human judgment and computational interpretation. We identify key challenges in eliciting and utilizing fine-grained feedback, prompting a reassessment of its assumed benefits and practicality. Our findings -- e.g., that fine-grained feedback can lead to worse models for a fixed budget, in some settings; however, in controlled settings with known attributes, fine grained rewards can indeed be more helpful -- call for careful consideration of feedback attributes and potentially beckon novel modeling approaches to appropriately unlock the potential value of fine-grained feedback in-the-wild.},

  abstract = {During spatial navigation, some typical parameters of learning have been observed, such as latency or path length. However, these parameters are sensitive to patterns of navigation and orientation that are not easily measurable. In the present study, we used a modified version of the Oasis maze and evaluated different parameters of learning, navigation, and orientation in different animal groups. Through a PCA (Principal component analysis) we found different factors such as learning, navigation, speediness, anxiety, orientation, path variability, and turning behavior. Each factor gathers different groups of behavioral variables. ANOVA analysis of those factors demonstrates that some of them are more strongly modulated by trial progression, while others by animal group differences, indicating that each group of variables is better reflecting one of these dimensions. To understand the nature of these navigation differences, we studied orientation strategies between animal conditions and across trials. We found that the main navigational strategy used by the animals consist of locating the target and directing their behaviors towards this area. When testing how this strategy changed after cognitive impairment or enhancement, we found that A{$\beta$}Os treated animals (Amyloid {$\beta$} Oligomers, Alzheimer animal model) have strong orientation difficulties at locating the target at longer distances. While animals with learning enhancement (exercised rat) do not show changes in orientation behaviors. These analyses highlight that experimental manipulations affect learning, but also induced changes in the navigational strategies. We concluded that both dimensions can explain the differences observed in typical learning variables, such as latency or path length, motivating the development of new tools that asses this two-dimension as a separate but, interacting phenomenon.},

Specifically, how can we embrace this technology to inform and enhance second language learning and teaching? In order to quantitatively characterize and index second language writing, the current work proposes the use of similarities derived from contextualized meaning representations in AI language models. The computational analysis in this work is hypothesis-driven. The current work predicts how similarities should be distributed in a second language learning setting. The results suggest that similarity metrics are informative of writing proficiency assessment and interlanguage development. Statistically significant effects were found across multiple AI models. Most of the metrics could distinguish language learners' proficiency levels. Significant correlations were also found between similarity metrics and learners' writing test scores provided by human experts in the domain. However, not all such effects were strong or interpretable. Several results could not be consistently explained under the proposed second language learning hypotheses.

  abstract = {The rapid development of large language models (LLMs) motivates us to explore how such state-of-the-art natural language processing systems can inform aphasia research. What kind of language indices can we derive from a pre-trained LLM? How do they differ from or relate to the existing language features in aphasia? To what extent can LLMs serve as an interpretable and effective diagnostic and measurement tool in a clinical context? To investigate these questions, we constructed predictive and correlational models, which utilize mean surprisals from LLMs as predictor variables. Using AphasiaBank archived data, we validated our models' efficacy in aphasia diagnosis, measurement, and prediction. Our finding is that LLMs-surprisals can effectively detect the presence of aphasia and different natures of the disorder, LLMs in conjunction with the existing language indices improve models' efficacy in subtyping aphasia, and LLMs-surprisals can capture common agrammatic deficits at both word and sentence level. Overall, LLMs have potential to advance automatic and precise aphasia prediction. A natural language processing pipeline can be greatly benefitted from integrating LLMs, enabling us to refine models of existing language disorders, such as aphasia.},

  abstract = {To what degree can language be acquired from linguistic input alone? This question has vexed scholars for millennia and is still a major focus of debate in the cognitive science of language. The complexity of human language has hampered progress because studies of language--especially those involving computational modeling--have only been able to deal with small fragments of our linguistic skills. We suggest that the most recent generation of Large Language Models (LLMs) might finally provide the computational tools to determine empirically how much of the human language ability can be acquired from linguistic experience. LLMs are sophisticated deep learning architectures trained on vast amounts of natural language data, enabling them to perform an impressive range of linguistic tasks. We argue that, despite their clear semantic and pragmatic limitations, LLMs have already demonstrated that human-like grammatical language can be acquired without the need for a built-in grammar. Thus, while there is still much to learn about how humans acquire and use language, LLMs provide fullfledged computational models for cognitive scientists to empirically evaluate just how far statistical learning might take us in explaining the full complexity of human language.},

This paper introduces an improved version of the Automated Model of Comprehension, namely version 4.0. AMoC has its roots in two theoretical models of the comprehension process (i.e., the Construction-Integration model and the Landscape model), and the new version leverages state-of-the-art Large Language models, more specifically ChatGPT, to have a better contextualization of the text and a simplified construction of the underlying graph model. Besides showcasing the usage of the model, the study introduces three in-depth psychological validations that argue for the model's adequacy in modeling reading comprehension. In these studies, we demonstrated that AMoC is in line with the theoretical background proposed by the Construction-Integration and Landscape models, and it is better at replicating results from previous human psychological experiments than its predecessor. Thus, AMoC v4.0 can be further used as an educational tool to, for example, help teachers design better learning materials personalized for student profiles. Additionally, we release the code from AMoC v4.0 as open source in a Google Collab Notebook and a GitHub repository.},

Although much work explores how people decompose tasks, there is less analysis of why people decompose tasks in the way they do. Here, we address this question by formalizing task decomposition as a resource-rational representation problem. Specifically, we propose that people decompose tasks in a manner that facilitates efficient use of limited cognitive resources given the structure of the environment and their own planning algorithms. Using this model, we replicate several existing findings. Our account provides a normative explanation for how people identify subtasks as well as a framework for studying how people reason, plan, and act using resourcerational representations.},

Amid growing threats to democracy, Costello               et al               . investigated whether dialogs with a generative artificial intelligence (AI) interface could convince people to abandon their conspiratorial beliefs (see the Perspective by Bago and Bonnefon). Human participants described a conspiracy theory that they subscribed to, and the AI then engaged in persuasive arguments with them that refuted their beliefs with evidence. The AI chatbot's ability to sustain tailored counterarguments and personalized in-depth conversations reduced their beliefs in conspiracies for months, challenging research suggesting that such beliefs are impervious to change. This intervention illustrates how deploying AI may mitigate conflicts and serve society. ---Ekeoma Uzogara                        ,                             INTRODUCTION               Widespread belief in unsubstantiated conspiracy theories is a major source of public concern and a focus of scholarly research. Despite often being quite implausible, many such conspiracies are widely believed. Prominent psychological theories propose that many people want to adopt conspiracy theories (to satisfy underlying psychic ``needs'' or motivations), and thus, believers cannot be convinced to abandon these unfounded and implausible beliefs using facts and counterevidence. Here, we question this conventional wisdom and ask whether it may be possible to talk people out of the conspiratorial ``rabbit hole'' with sufficiently compelling evidence.                                         RATIONALE               We hypothesized that interventions based on factual, corrective information may seem ineffective simply because they lack sufficient depth and personalization. To test this hypothesis, we leveraged advancements in large language models (LLMs), a form of artificial intelligence (AI) that has access to vast amounts of information and the ability to generate bespoke arguments. LLMs can thereby directly refute particular evidence each individual cites as supporting their conspiratorial beliefs.               To do so, we developed a pipeline for conducting behavioral science research using real-time, personalized interactions between research subjects and AI. Across two experiments, 2190 Americans articulated---in their own words---a conspiracy theory in which they believe, along with the evidence they think supports this theory. They then engaged in a three-round conversation with the LLM GPT-4 Turbo, which we prompted to respond to this specific evidence while trying to reduce participants' belief in the conspiracy theory (or, as a control condition, to converse with the AI about an unrelated topic).                                         RESULTS               The treatment reduced participants' belief in their chosen conspiracy theory by 20\% on average. This effect persisted undiminished for at least 2 months; was consistently observed across a wide range of conspiracy theories, from classic conspiracies involving the assassination of John F. Kennedy, aliens, and the illuminati, to those pertaining to topical events such as COVID-19 and the 2020 US presidential election; and occurred even for participants whose conspiracy beliefs were deeply entrenched and important to their identities. Notably, the AI did not reduce belief in true conspiracies. Furthermore, when a professional fact-checker evaluated a sample of 128 claims made by the AI, 99.2\% were true, 0.8\% were misleading, and none were false. The debunking also spilled over to reduce beliefs in unrelated conspiracies, indicating a general decrease in conspiratorial worldview, and increased intentions to rebut other conspiracy believers.                                         CONCLUSION               Many people who strongly believe in seemingly fact-resistant conspiratorial beliefs can change their minds when presented with compelling evidence. From a theoretical perspective, this paints a surprisingly optimistic picture of human reasoning: Conspiratorial rabbit holes may indeed have an exit. Psychological needs and motivations do not inherently blind conspiracists to evidence---it simply takes the right evidence to reach them. Practically, by demonstrating the persuasive power of LLMs, our findings emphasize both the potential positive impacts of generative AI when deployed responsibly and the pressing importance of minimizing opportunities for this technology to be used irresponsibly.                                                   Dialogues with AI durably reduce conspiracy beliefs even among strong believers.

  abstract = {Modern machine learning models yield vector representations that capture similarity relations between complex items like text and images. These representations can help explain and predict how individuals respond to those items in particular tasks, but only if representations are coupled to a cognitive model of the processes people use to perform those tasks. I introduce C2L (``context to likelihood''), a mathematical transformation of the similarity between vector representations, operationalized as the cosine of the angle between them, into a ratio of the relative likelihood that the two representations encode the same versus different items. The likelihood ratio operationalizes similarity in a manner that is motivated by cognitive theories of perception and memory and is readily ``plugged in'' to cognitive models. Two example applications show how C2L can be used to compute drift rates of a diffusion decision model based on similarity information derived from machine learning models, thereby accounting for the speed and accuracy with which individual participants recognize individual items. C2L enables inferences regarding how different people represent items, how much information they encode about each item, and how that information is affected by experimental manipulations. C2L serves both the practical purpose of making it easier to incorporate representations from machine learning into cognitive models and the theoretical purpose of allowing cognitive models to grant insight into how people process the increasingly complex, naturalistic items to which machine learning models are applied.},

One way in which individual differences emerge is through differences in knowledge. In dynamic situations, where decisions are made from experience, models built upon a theory of experiential choice (instance-based learning theory; IBLT) can provide accurate predictions of individual human learning and adaptivity to changing environments. Here, we demonstrate how an instance-based learning (IBL) cognitive model, implemented in a cognitive architecture (Adaptive Control of Thought--Rational), can be used to model an individual's decisions in a cybersecurity defense task, accounting for both population average and individual variances. The same IBL model structure with identical architectural parameters generates the full range of human behavior through stochastic memory retrieval processes operating over and contributing to unique experiences. Recurrence quantification analyses allow us to look beyond average behavior between and within individuals to sequential patterns of trial-to-trial behavior. We show how model-tracing and knowledge-tracing techniques can be used to align the model to an individual in real time to drive adaptive and personalized signaling algorithms for a cybersecurity defense system. We also present a method for introspecting into the cognitive model to gain further insight into the cognitive salience of features factored into individual decisions. The combination of techniques provides a blueprint for personalized modeling of individuals. We discuss the results and implications of this adaptive and personalized method for cybersecurity defense and more generally for intelligent artifacts tailored to individual differences in domains such as human--machine teaming.},

However, the interactions in human-AI systems are inherently complex, involving intricate processes and interdependencies. This review incorporates perspectives from complex network science to conceptualize a multilayer representation of human-AI collective intelligence, comprising cognition, physical, and information layers. Within this multilayer network, humans and AI agents exhibit varying characteristics; humans differ in diversity from surface-level to deep-level attributes, while AI agents range in degrees of functionality and anthropomorphism.

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into scientific research, particularly in the social sciences, where understanding human behavior is critical. Large Language Models (LLMs) such as GPT-4 have shown promise in replicating human-like responses in various psychological experiments. However, the extent to which LLMs can effectively replace human subjects across diverse experimental contexts remains unclear. Here, we conduct a large-scale study replicating 154 psychological experiments from top social science journals with 618 main effects and 138 interaction effects using GPT-4 as a simulated participant. We find that GPT-4 successfully replicates 76.0\% of main effects and 47.0\% of interaction effects observed in original studies, closely mirroring human responses in both direction and significance. However, only 19.44\% of GPT-4's replicated confidence intervals contain the original effect sizes, with the majority of replicated effect sizes exceeding the 95\% confidence interval of the original studies and showing a 71.6\% rate of unexpected significant results where the original studies reported null findings, suggesting potential overestimation or false positives. Our results demonstrate the potential of LLMs as powerful tools in psychological research but also emphasize the need for caution in interpreting AI-driven findings. While LLMs can complement human studies, they cannot yet fully replace the nuanced insights provided by human subjects.},

  abstract = {Visualization items---factual questions about visualizations that ask viewers to accomplish visualization tasks---are regularly used in the field of information visualization as educational and evaluative materials. For example, researchers of visualization literacy require large, diverse banks of items to conduct studies where the same skill is measured repeatedly on the same participants. Yet, generating a large number of high-quality, diverse items requires significant time and expertise. To address the critical need for a large number of diverse visualization items in education and research, this paper investigates the potential for large language models (LLMs) to automate the generation of multiple-choice visualization items. Through an iterative design process, we develop the VILA (Visualization Items Generated by Large LAnguage Models) pipeline, for efficiently generating visualization items that measure people's ability to accomplish visualization tasks. We use the VILA pipeline to generate 1,404 candidate items across 12 chart types and 13 visualization tasks. In collaboration with 11 visualization experts, we develop an evaluation rulebook which we then use to rate the quality of all candidate items. The result is the VILA bank of {$\sim$}1,100 items. From this evaluation, we also identify and classify current limitations of the VILA pipeline, and discuss the role of human oversight in ensuring quality. In addition, we demonstrate an application of our work by creating a visualization literacy test, VILA-VLAT, which measures people's ability to complete a diverse set of tasks on various types of visualizations; comparing it to the existing VLAT, VILA-VLAT shows moderate to high convergent validity (R = 0.70). Lastly, we discuss the application areas of the VILA pipeline and the VILA bank and provide practical recommendations for their use.

  abstract = {With the emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) and Vision Foundation Models (VFMs), multimodal AI systems benefiting from large models have the potential to equally perceive the real world, make decisions, and control tools as humans. In recent months, LLMs have shown widespread attention in autonomous driving and map systems. Despite its immense potential, there is still a lack of a comprehensive understanding of key challenges, opportunities, and future endeavors to apply in LLM driving systems. In this paper, we present a systematic investigation in this field. We first introduce the background of Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs), the multimodal models development using LLMs, and the history of autonomous driving. Then, we overview existing MLLM tools for driving, transportation, and map systems together with existing datasets and benchmarks. Moreover, we summarized the works in The 1st WACV Workshop on Large Language and Vision Models for Autonomous Driving (LLVM-AD), which is the first workshop of its kind regarding LLMs in autonomous driving. To further promote the development of this field, we also discuss several important problems regarding using MLLMs in autonomous driving systems that need to be solved by both academia and industry.},

  abstract = {This paper presents a multi-dimensional view of AI's role in learning and education, emphasizing the intricate interplay between AI, analytics, and the learning processes. Here, I challenge the prevalent narrow conceptualisation of AI as tools, as exemplified in generative AI tools, and argue for the importance of alternative conceptualisations of AI for achieving human-AI hybrid intelligence. I highlight the differences between human intelligence and artificial information processing, the importance of hybrid human-AI systems to extend human cognition, and posit that AI can also serve as an instrument for understanding human learning. Early learning sciences and AI in Education research (AIED), which saw AI as an analogy for human intelligence, have diverged from this perspective, prompting a need to rekindle this connection. The paper presents three unique conceptualisations of AI: the externalization of human cognition, the internalization of AI models to influence human mental models, and the extension of human cognition via tightly coupled human-AI hybrid intelligence systems. Examples from current research and practice are examined as instances of the three conceptualisations in education, highlighting the potential value and limitations of each conceptualisation for education, as well as the perils of overemphasis on externalising human cognition. The paper concludes with advocacy for a broader approach to AIED that goes beyond considerations on the design and development of AI, but also includes educating people about AI and innovating educational systems to remain relevant in an AI-ubiquitous world.},

  abstract = {A recent neuropsychological study found that amnesic patients with hippocampal damage (HP) and severe declarative memory impairment produce markedly fewer responses than healthy comparison (CO) participants in a semantic feature generation task (Klooster and Duff, 2015), consistent with the idea that hippocampal damage is associated with semantic cognitive deficits. Participants were presented with a target word and asked to produce as many features of that word as possible (e.g., for target word ``book,'' ``read words on a page''). Here, we use the response sequences collected by Klooster and Duff (2015) to develop a vector space model of semantic search. We use this model to characterize the dynamics of semantic feature generation and consider the role of the hippocampus in this search process. Both HP and CO groups tended to initiate the search process with features close in semantic space to the target word, with a gradual decline in similarity to the target word over the first several responses. Adjacent features in the response sequence showed stronger similarity to each other than to non-adjacent features, suggesting that the search process follows a local trajectory in semantic space. Overall, HP patients generated features that were closer in semantic space to the representation of the target word, as compared to the features generated by the CO group, which ranged more widely in semantic space. These results are consistent with a model in which a compound retrieval cue (containing a representation of the target word and a representation of the previous response) is used to probe semantic memory. The model suggests that the HP group's search process is restricted from ranging as far in semantic space from the target word, relative to the CO group. These results place strong constraints on the structure of models of semantic memory search, and on the role of hippocampus in probing semantic memory.},

In this work, we study representations of sentences in one such artificial system for natural language processing. We first present a diagnostic test dataset to examine the degree of abstract composable structure represented. Analyzing performance on these diagnostic tests indicates a lack of systematicity in representations and decision rules, and reveals a set of heuristic strategies. We then investigate the effect of training distribution on learning these heuristic strategies, and we study changes in these representations with various augmentations to the training set. Our results reveal parallels to the analogous representations in people. We find that these systems can learn abstract rules and generalize them to new contexts under certain circumstances---similar to human zero-shot reasoning. However, we also note some shortcomings in this generalization behavior---similar to human judgment errors like belief bias. Studying these parallels suggests new ways to understand psychological phenomena in humans as well as informs best strategies for building artificial intelligence with human-like language understanding.},

Human-centered evaluation of AI-based systems combines quantitative and qualitative analysis and human input. It has been explored to some depth in the explainable AI (XAI) and human-computer interaction (HCI) communities. Gaps remain, but the basic understanding that humans interact with AI and accompanying explanations, and that humans' needs -- complete with their cognitive biases and quirks -- should be held front and center, is accepted by the community. In this paper, we draw parallels between the relatively mature field of XAI and the rapidly evolving research boom around large language models (LLMs). Accepted evaluative metrics for LLMs are not human-centered. We argue that many of the same paths tread by the XAI community over the past decade will be retread when discussing LLMs. Specifically, we argue that humans' tendencies -- again, complete with their cognitive biases and quirks -- should rest front and center when evaluating deployed LLMs. We outline three developed focus areas of human-centered evaluation of XAI: mental models, use case utility, and cognitive engagement, and we highlight the importance of exploring each of these concepts for LLMs. Our goal is to jumpstart human-centered LLM evaluation.},

Despite considerable empirical and computational work on goals and goal-oriented behavior, models are still far from capturing the richness of everyday human goals. Here, we bridge this gap by collecting a dataset of human-generated playful goals, modeling them as reward-producing programs, and generating novel human-like goals through program synthesis. Reward-producing programs capture the rich semantics of goals through symbolic operations that compose, add temporal constraints, and allow for program execution on behavioral traces to evaluate progress. To build a generative model of goals, we learn a fitness function over the infinite set of possible goal programs and sample novel goals with a quality-diversity algorithm. Human evaluators found that model-generated goals, when sampled from partitions of program space occupied by human examples, were indistinguishable from human-created games. We also discovered that our model's internal fitness scores predict games that are evaluated as more fun to play and more human-like.},

While many studies have focused on subsets of math concepts such as numbers, fractions, or geometric shapes, few have ventured beyond these elementary domains. Here, we attempted to map out the full space of math concepts and to answer two specific questions: can distributed semantic models, such a GloVe, provide a satisfactory fit to human semantic judgments in mathematics? And how does this fit vary with education? We first analyzed all of the French and English Wikipedia pages with math contents, and used a semi-automatic procedure to extract the 1,000 most frequent math terms in both languages. In a second step, we collected extensive behavioral judgments of familiarity and semantic similarity between them. About half of the variance in human similarity judgments was explained by vector embeddings that attempt to capture latent semantic structures based on cooccurence statistics. Participants' self-reported level of education modulated familiarity and similarity, allowing us to create a partial hierarchy among high-level math concepts. Our results converge onto the proposal of a map of math space, organized as a database of math terms with information about their frequency, familiarity, grade of acquisition, and entanglement with other concepts.                        Author summary             Most studies in mathematical cognition focus on subdomains such as numbers, fractions, or geometric shapes. A broader picture of the full extent of mathematical cognition is lacking. Here, as a first step, we use behavioral and computational methods to create a comprehensive vocabulary of advanced math. We prove that statistical cooccurence vectors from large corpora (Wikipedia) provide an approximation of the meaning and organization of these concepts, as measured by human similarity ratings in participants of varying levels of education. Results are similar in French and in English, suggesting that our findings do not depend on the language. In future work, we plan to leverage this vocabulary to explore the brain mechanism of math cognition at various levels of expertise.},

In this paper, we consider partially observed environments (POEs), where an agent receives perceptually aliased observations as it navigates, which makes path planning hard. We introduce a transformer with (multiple) discrete bottleneck(s), TDB, whose latent codes learn a compressed representation of the history of observations and actions. After training a TDB to predict the future observation(s) given the history, we extract interpretable cognitive maps of the environment from its active bottleneck(s) indices. These maps are then paired with an external solver to solve (constrained) path planning problems. First, we show that a TDB trained on POEs (a) retains the near perfect predictive performance of a vanilla transformer or an LSTM while (b) solving shortest path problems exponentially faster. Second, a TDB extracts interpretable representations from text datasets, while reaching higher in-context accuracy than vanilla sequence models. Finally, in new POEs, a TDB (a) reaches near-perfect in-context accuracy, (b) learns accurate in-context cognitive maps (c) solves in-context path planning problems.},

Yet, we poorly understand the processes governing dynamically-interacting individuals in human collectives under realistic conditions. We present a naturalistic immersive-reality experiment where groups of participants searched for rewards in different environments, studying how individuals weigh personal and social information and how this shapes individual and collective outcomes. Capturing high-resolution visual-spatial data, behavioral analyses revealed individual-level gains---but group-level losses---of high social information use and spatial proximity in environments with concentrated (vs. distributed) resources. Incentivizing participants at the group (vs. individual) level facilitated adaptation to concentrated environments, buffering apparently excessive scrounging. To infer discrete choices from unconstrained interactions and uncover the underlying decision mechanisms, we developed an unsupervised Social Hidden Markov Decision model. Computational results showed that participants were more sensitive to social information in concentrated environments frequently switching to a social relocation state where they approach successful group members. Group-level incentives reduced participants' overall responsiveness to social information and promoted higher selectivity over time. Finally, mapping group-level spatio-temporal dynamics through time-lagged regressions revealed a collective exploration-exploitation trade-off across different timescales. Our study unravels the processes linking individual-level strategies to emerging collective dynamics, and provides tools to investigate decision-making in freely-interacting collectives.},

Their approach through mandates and federal legislation focused predominantly on new construction and major retrofits to existing facilities. To meet future energy and emission reduction goals, more emphasis on facility management is needed. The government manages over 370 million square feet of facilities each year. The daily decision process for government facility managers is full of competing interests, such as maintenance needs (preventative and corrective), limited operating budgets, time constraints to make decisions, and bounded rationality about energy consumption and savings. By understanding how these decisions are made and the cognitive bias that may occur, advances in facility management decision making can reduce energy consumption. Cognitive biases to the decision making process such as loss aversion, anchoring, and status quo bias are explored and an approach to overcome them is offered, a tactic called choice architecture, meaning restructuring decision environments to align with behavioral decision theory. Examples of choice architecture, such as, enabling procurement systems to query green products, changing default settings in mechanical systems, and requiring the use of pay back period calculators to account for cognitive limitations of the decision maker, are suggested and supported by behavioral science research to help direct facility managers towards energy efficient choices. This approach, through choice architecture, holds potential to yield relatively low-cost solutions (they do not require new mandates or laws) to support greater energy reduction in government facility management. This merging of literature from behavioral science to facility management is meant to open new avenues of interdisciplinary research.},

What determines whether a neural network model generalises like a human? We tested how well the representations of 86 pretrained neural network models mapped to human learning trajectories across two tasks where humans had to learn continuous relationships and categories of natural images. In these tasks, both human participants and neural networks successfully identified the relevant stimulus features within a few trials, demonstrating effective generalisation. We found that while training dataset size was a core determinant of alignment with human choices, contrastive training with multi-modal data (text and imagery) was a common feature of currently publicly available models that predicted human generalisation. Intrinsic dimensionality of representations had different effects on alignment for different model types. Lastly, we tested three sets of human-aligned representations and found no consistent improvements in predictive accuracy compared to the baselines. In conclusion, pretrained neural networks can serve to extract representations for cognitive models, as they appear to capture some fundamental aspects of cognition that are transferable across tasks. Both our paradigms and modelling approach offer a novel way to quantify alignment between neural networks and humans and extend cognitive science into more naturalistic domains.},

To investigate this phenomenon and determine the most effective representations for predicting human behavior, we conducted two experiments involving category learning and reward learning. Our experiments used realistic images as stimuli, and participants were tasked with making accurate decisions based on novel stimuli for all trials, thereby necessitating generalization. In both tasks, the underlying rules were generated as simple linear functions using stimulus dimensions extracted from human similarity judgments. Notably, participants successfully identified the relevant stimulus features within a few trials, demonstrating effective generalization. We performed an extensive model comparison, evaluating the trial-by-trial predictive accuracy of diverse deep learning models' representations of human choices. Intriguingly, representations from models trained on both text and image data consistently outperformed models trained solely on images, even surpassing models using the features that generated the task itself. These findings suggest that language-aligned visual representations possess sufficient richness to describe human generalization in naturalistic settings and emphasize the role of language in shaping human cognition.},

We argue that although LLMs have the potential to advance psychological measurement, experimentation and practice, they are not yet ready for many of the most transformative psychological applications --- but further research and development may enable such use. Next, we examine four major concerns about the application of LLMs to psychology, and how each might be overcome. Finally, we conclude with recommendations for investments that could help to address these concerns: feld-initiated `keystone' datasets; increased standardization of performance benchmarks; and shared computing and analysis infrastructure to ensure that the future of LLM-powered research is equitable.},

  abstract = {Humans are universally good in providing stable and accurate judgments about what forms part of their language and what not. Large Language Models (LMs) are claimed to possess human-like language abilities; hence, they are expected to emulate this behavior by providing both stable and accurate answers, when asked whether a string of words complies with or deviates from their next-word predictions. This work tests whether stability and accuracy are showcased by GPT-3/text-davinci-002, GPT-3/text-davinci-003, and ChatGPT, using a series of judgment tasks that tap on 8 linguistic phenomena: plural attraction, anaphora, center embedding, comparatives, intrusive resumption, negative polarity items, order of adjectives, and order of adverbs. For every phenomenon, 10 sentences (5 grammatical and 5 ungrammatical) are tested, each randomly repeated 10 times, totaling 800 elicited judgments per LM (total n = 2,400). Our results reveal variable above-chance accuracy in the grammatical condition, below-chance accuracy in the ungrammatical condition, a significant instability of answers across phenomena, and a yes-response bias for all the tested LMs. Furthermore, we found no evidence that repetition aids the Models to converge on a processing strategy that culminates in stable answers, either accurate or inaccurate. We demonstrate that the LMs' performance in identifying (un)grammatical word patterns is in stark contrast to what is observed in humans (n = 80, tested on the same tasks) and argue that adopting LMs as theories of human language is not motivated at their current stage of development.},

Their success in specialized tasks has led to the claim that they possess human-like linguistic capabilities related to compositional understanding and reasoning. Yet, reverse-engineering is bound by Moravec's Paradox, according to which easy skills are hard. We systematically assess 7 state-of-the-art models on a novel benchmark. Models answered a series of comprehension questions, each prompted multiple times in two settings, permitting one-word or open-length replies. Each question targets a short text featuring high-frequency linguistic constructions. To establish a baseline for achieving human-like performance, we tested 400 humans on the same prompts. Based on a dataset of n\,=\,26,680 datapoints, we discovered that LLMs perform at chance accuracy and waver considerably in their answers. Quantitatively, the tested models are outperformed by humans, and qualitatively their answers showcase distinctly non-human errors in language understanding. We interpret this evidence as suggesting that, despite their usefulness in various tasks, current AI models fall short of understanding language in a way that matches humans, and we argue that this may be due to their lack of a compositional operator for regulating grammatical and semantic information.},

While most word pairs in these triads are weakly related, humans agree on which to choose. This is theoretically interesting as it contradicts previous claims that suggest that the notion of similarity is unconstrained in principle (e.g., Goodman, 1972). Here, we present new evidence from GPT-4, showing that context-aware LLMs provide excellent predictions of this task. Moreover, the strength of this effect was even larger than that found for basic-level comparisons, which involve highly similar items. Together, this implies that the similarity of human representations is highly structured at every scale, even in tasks with limited context. Follow-up analysis provides insights into how LLMs are successful in this task. Further implications of the ability to compare words at every scale are discussed.

In this article, we first briefly assess the similarities and differences in the judgment and decisionmaking (JDM) situations that people may face in the metaverse compared to their physical environments. Next, we discuss how human interaction with metaverse-related advanced technologies may affect the cognitive processes of perception, attention, memory, and reasoning that underlie human JDM, as well as the subsequent effects of these processes on JDM, in both the virtual and physical worlds. Finally, we highlight some opportunities that the metaverse may afford decision scientists, given the availability of integrated digitalized data collected from users (or research participants) as well as some of the challenges that lie therein. We structure these opportunities around the five key metaverse domains: digitalization, virtualization, social networks, virtual worlds, and data integration. As a research platform, the metaverse can help drive a paradigm shift away from traditional approaches to JDM research and enable decision scientists to test and consolidate existing theories as well as advance new ones, while conducting research that has social benefits.},

Traffic emerges from the interaction of a big number of agents implementing those behaviours, but until recent years, modelling it by the interaction of these agents in the so called micro-simulators was a nearly impossible task as their number grows. However, with the growing computing power it is possible to model increasingly large quantities of individual vehicles according to their individual behaviours. These models are usually composed of two sub-models for two well-defined tasks: car-following and lane-change. In the case of lane-change the literature proposes many different models, but few of them use Computational Intelligence (CI) techniques, and much less use personalization for reaching individual granularity. This study explores one of the two aspects of the lane-change called lane-change acceptance, where the driver performs or not a lane-change given his intention and the vehicle environment. We demonstrate how the lane-change acceptance of a specific driver can be learned from his lane change intention and surrounding environment in an urban scenario using CI techniques such as feed-forward Artificial Neural Network (ANN). We work with Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) architectures. How they perform one against the other and how the different topologies affect both to the generalization of the problem and the learning process are studied.},

  abstract = {Cognitive scientists commonly collect participants' judgments regarding perceptual characteristics of stimuli to develop and evaluate memory, learning, and decision-making models. For instance, to model human responses in tasks of category learning and item recognition, researchers often have to collect perceptual judgments of images to embed the images in multidimensional feature spaces. This process is time-consuming and costly. Recent advancements in Large Multimodal Models (LMMs) provide a potential alternative since such models can respond to prompts that include both text and images and could potentially replace human participants. To test whether the available LMMs can indeed be useful for this purpose, we evaluated their judgments on a dataset consisting of rock images that has been widely used by cognitive scientists. The dataset includes human perceptual judgments along ten dimensions considered important for classifying rock images. While the models exhibited a strong positive correlation with human responses, we found that they fell short in replacing an average of a set of judgments from human participants. The models provided correlations with these averaged data that were roughly the same magnitude as observed for individual participants, especially for dimensions that are relatively general (such as lightness and chromaticity) as opposed to domain-specific dimensions (such as pegmatitic structure), where they struggled more. We also found that modifying prompts and providing additional examples of images with corresponding ratings had a positive but relatively modest impact on model performance. Our study provides a benchmark for evaluating future LMMs on human perceptual judgment data.},

LLMs are appearing rapidly, and debates on LLM capacities have taken off, but reflection is lagging behind. Thus, in this position paper, we first zoom in on the debate and critically assess three points recurring in critiques of LLM capacities: i) that LLMs only parrot statistical patterns in the training data; ii) that LLMs master formal but not functional language competence; and iii) that language learning in LLMs cannot inform human language learning. Drawing on empirical and theoretical arguments, we show that these points need more nuance. Second, we outline a pragmatic perspective on the issue of `real' understanding and intentionality in LLMs. Understanding and intentionality pertain to unobservable mental states we attribute to other humans because they have pragmatic value: they allow us to abstract away from complex underlying mechanics and predict behaviour effectively. We reflect on the circumstances under which it would make sense for humans to similarly attribute mental states to LLMs, thereby outlining a pragmatic philosophical context for LLMs as an increasingly prominent technology in society.},

However, the reliability and potential usefulness of this capacity for augmenting human creative work has received little systematic exploration. In this paper, we systematically explore LLMs capacity to augment cross-domain analogical reasoning. Across three studies, we found: 1) LLM-generated cross-domain analogies were frequently judged as helpful in the context of a problem reformulation task (median 4 out of 5 helpfulness rating), and frequently ({$\sim$} 80\% of cases) led to observable changes in problem formulations, and 2) there was an upper bound of {$\sim$} 25\% of outputs being rated as potentially harmful, with a majority due to potentially upsetting content, rather than biased or toxic content. These results demonstrate the potential utility --- and risks --- of LLMs for augmenting cross-domain analogical creativity.},

While the ML model was trained on 120,000 pre-labelled injury narratives, LLM and humans did not receive any specialized training. The explainability of different approaches was compared based on the top words they used for making classification decision. These words were identified using eye-tracking for humans, explainable AI approach LIME for ML model, and prompts for LLM. The classification performance of ML model was observed to be relatively better than zero-shot LLM and non-expert humans, overall, and particularly for narratives with high complexity and difficult categorization. The top-3 predictive words used by ML and LLM for classification agreed with humans to a greater extent as compared to later predictive words.},

Technical advancements have been made in algorithms that detect hallucinated content by assessing the factuality of the model's responses and attributing sections of those responses to specific source documents. However, there is limited research on how to effectively communicate this information to users in ways that will help them appropriately calibrate their trust toward LLMs. To address this issue, we conducted a scenario-based study (N=104) to systematically compare the impact of various design strategies for communicating factuality and source attribution on participants' ratings of trust, preferences, and ease in validating response accuracy. Our findings reveal that participants preferred a design in which phrases within a response were color-coded based on the computed factuality scores the most. Participants found it easy to validate the accuracy of an LLM's response and increased their trust in this style compared to a baseline in which no style was applied. Additionally, participants increased their trust ratings when relevant sections of the source material were highlighted or responses were annotated with reference numbers corresponding to those sources, compared to when they received no annotation in the source material. Our study offers practical design guidelines to facilitate human-LLM collaboration and it promotes a new human role to carefully evaluate and take responsibility for their use of LLM outputs.},

  abstract = {Collective movement may emerge if coordinating one's movement with others produces a greater benefit to oneself than can be achieved alone. Experimentally, the capacity to manoeuvre simulated groups in the wild could enable powerful tests of the impact of collective movement on individual decisions. Yet such experiments are currently lacking due to the inherent difficulty of controlling whole collectives. Here we used a novel technique of experimentally simulating the movement of collectives of social hermit crabs (Coenobita compressus) in the wild. Using large architectural arrays of shells dragged across the beach, we generated synchronous collective movement and systematically varied the simulated collective's travel direction as well as the context (i.e., danger level). With drone video from above, we then tested whether focal individuals were biased in their movement by the collective. We found that, despite considerable engagement with the collective, individuals' direction was not significantly biased. Instead, individuals expressed substantial variability across all stimulus directions and contexts. Notably, individuals typically achieved shorter displacements in the presence of the collective versus in the presence of the control stimulus, suggesting an impact of traffic. The absence of a directional bias in individual movement due to the collective suggests that social hermit crabs are individualists, which move with a high level of opportunistic independence, likely thanks to the personal architecture and armour they carry in the form of a protective shell. Future studies can manipulate this level of armour to test its role in autonomy of movement, including the consequences of shell architecture for social decisions. Our novel experimental approach can be used to ask many further questions about how and why collective and individual movement interact.},

  abstract = {With large language models (LLMs) appearing to behave increasingly human-like in text-based interactions, it has become popular to attempt to evaluate various properties of these models using tests originally designed for humans. While re-using existing tests is a resource-efficient way to evaluate LLMs, careful adjustments are usually required to ensure that test results are even valid across human sub-populations. Thus, it is not clear to what extent different tests' validity generalizes to LLMs. In this work, we provide evidence that LLMs' responses to personality tests systematically deviate from typical human responses, implying that these results cannot be interpreted in the same way as human test results. Concretely, reverse-coded items (e.g. "I am introverted" vs "I am extraverted") are often both answered affirmatively by LLMs. In addition, variation across different prompts designed to "steer" LLMs to simulate particular personality types does not follow the clear separation into five independent personality factors from human samples. In light of these results, we believe it is important to pay more attention to tests' validity for LLMs before drawing strong conclusions about potentially ill-defined concepts like LLMs' "personality".},

  abstract = {In-Context Learning (ICL) and Instruction Tuning (IT) are two primary paradigms of adopting Large Language Models (LLMs) to downstream applications. However, they are significantly different. In ICL, a set of demonstrations are provided at inference time but the LLM's parameters are not updated. In IT, a set of demonstrations are used to tune LLM's parameters in training time but no demonstrations are used at inference time. Although a growing body of literature has explored ICL and IT, studies on these topics have largely been conducted in isolation, leading to a disconnect between these two paradigms. In this work, we explore the relationship between ICL and IT by examining how the hidden states of LLMs change in these two paradigms. Through carefully designed experiments conducted with LLaMA-2 (7B and 13B), we find that ICL is implicit IT. In other words, ICL changes an LLM's hidden states as if the demonstrations were used to instructionally tune the model. Furthermore, the convergence between ICL and IT is largely contingent upon several factors related to the provided demonstrations. Overall, this work offers a unique perspective to explore the connection between ICL and IT and sheds light on understanding the behaviors of LLM.},

  abstract = {The conceptualization and categorization of natural objects in the human mind have long intrigued cognitive scientists and neuroscientists, offering crucial insights into human perception and cognition. Recently, the rapid development of Large Language Models (LLMs) has raised the attractive question of whether these models can also develop human-like object representations through exposure to vast amounts of linguistic and multimodal data. In this study, we combined behavioral and neuroimaging analysis methods to uncover how the object concept representations in LLMs correlate with those of humans. By collecting large-scale datasets of 4.7 million triplet judgments from LLM and Multimodal LLM (MLLM), we were able to derive low-dimensional embeddings that capture the underlying similarity structure of 1,854 natural objects. The resulting 66-dimensional embeddings were found to be highly stable and predictive, and exhibited semantic clustering akin to human mental representations. Interestingly, the interpretability of the dimensions underlying these embeddings suggests that LLM and MLLM have developed human-like conceptual representations of natural objects. Further analysis demonstrated strong alignment between the identified model embeddings and neural activity patterns in many functionally defined brain ROIs (e.g., EBA, PPA, RSC and FFA). This provides compelling evidence that the object representations in LLMs, while not identical to those in the human, share fundamental commonalities that reflect key schemas of human conceptual knowledge. This study advances our understanding of machine intelligence and informs the development of more human-like artificial cognitive systems.},

Emerging research explores the use of LLMs in collective problem-solving endeavors, such as tasks where groups try to uncover clues through discussions. Although prior work has investigated individual problem-solving tasks, leveraging LLM-powered agents for group consensus and decision-making remains largely unexplored. This research addresses this gap by (1) proposing an algorithm to enable free-form conversation in groups of LLM agents, (2) creating metrics to evaluate the human-likeness of the generated dialogue and problem-solving performance, and (3) evaluating LLM agent groups against human groups using an open source dataset. Our results reveal that LLM groups outperform human groups in problem-solving tasks. LLM groups also show a greater improvement in scores after participating in free discussions. In particular, analyses indicate that LLM agent groups exhibit more disagreements, complex statements, and a propensity for positive statements compared to human groups. The results shed light on the potential of LLMs to facilitate collective reasoning and provide insight into the dynamics of group interactions involving synthetic LLM agents.},

Our work introduces BIASBUSTER, a framework designed to uncover, evaluate, and mitigate cognitive bias in LLMs, particularly in high-stakes decision-making tasks. Inspired by prior research in psychology and cognitive sciences, we develop a dataset containing 16,800 prompts to evaluate different cognitive biases (e.g., prompt-induced, sequential, inherent). We test various bias mitigation strategies, amidst proposing a novel method utilising LLMs to debias their own prompts. Our analysis provides a comprehensive picture on the presence and effects of cognitive bias across different commercial and open-source models. We demonstrate that our self-help debiasing effectively mitigate cognitive bias without having to manually craft examples for each bias type.},

  abstract = {An important component of many Adaptive Instructional Systems (AIS) is a `Learner Model' intended to track student learning and predict future performance. Predictions from learner models are frequently used in combination with mastery criterion decision rules to make pedagogical decisions. Important aspects of learner models, such as learning rate and item difficulty, can be estimated from prior data. A critical function of AIS is to have students practice new content once the AIS predicts that they have `mastered' current content or learned it to some criterion. For making this prediction, individual student parameters (e.g., for learning rate) are frequently unavailable due to having no prior data about a student, and thus population-level parameters or rules-of-thumb are typically applied instead. In this paper, we will argue and demonstrate via simulation and data analysis that even in best-case scenarios, learner models assuming equal learning rates for students will inevitably lead to systematic errors that result in suboptimal pedagogical decisions for most learners. This finding leads us to conclude that systematic errors should be expected, and mechanisms to adjust predictions to account for them should be included in AIS. We introduce two solutions that can adjust for student differences ``online'' in a running system: one that tracks systemic errors of the learner model (not the student) and adjusts accordingly, and a student-level performance adaptive feature. We demonstrate these solutions' efficacy and practicality on six large educational datasets and show that these features improved model accuracy in all tested datasets.},

However, understanding the influencing factors of LLM-assisted decision-making is crucial for enabling individuals to utilize LLM-provided advantages and minimize associated risks in order to make more informed and better decisions. This study presents the results of a comprehensive literature analysis, providing a structural overview and detailed analysis of determinants impacting decision-making with LLM support. In particular, we explore the effects of technological aspects of LLMs, including transparency and prompt engineering, psychological factors such as emotions and decision-making styles, as well as decision specific determinants such as task difficulty and accountability. In addition, the impact of the determinants on the decision-making process is illustrated via multiple application scenarios. Drawing from our analysis, we develop a dependency framework that systematizes possible interactions in terms of reciprocal interdependencies between these determinants. Our research reveals that, due to the multifaceted interactions with various determinants, factors such as trust in or reliance on LLMs, the user's mental model, and the characteristics of information processing are identified as significant aspects influencing LLM-assisted decision-making processes. Our findings can be seen as crucial for improving decision quality in human-AI collaboration, empowering both users and organizations, and designing more effective LLM interfaces.

Focusing on the case of syllogisms -- inferences from two simple premises, which have been studied extensively in psychology -- we show that larger models are more logical than smaller ones, and also more logical than humans. At the same time, even the largest models make systematic errors, some of which mirror human reasoning biases such as ordering effects and logical fallacies.

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence has made great strides since the deep learning revolution, but AI systems remain incapable of learning principles and rules which allow them to extrapolate outside of their training data to new situations. For inspiration we look to the domain of science, where scientists have been able to develop theories which show remarkable ability to extrapolate and sometimes even predict the existence of phenomena which have never been observed before. According to David Deutsch, this type of extrapolation, which he calls ``reach'', is due to scientific theories being hard to vary. In this work we investigate Deutsch's hard-to-vary principle and how it relates to more formalized principles in deep learning such as the bias-variance trade-off and Occam's razor. We distinguish internal variability, how much a model/theory can be varied internally while still yielding the same predictions, with external variability, which is how much a model must be varied to predict new, out-of-distribution data. We discuss how to measure internal variability using the notion of the Rashomon set and how to measure external variability using Kolmogorov complexity. We explore what role hard-to-vary explanations play in intelligence by looking at the human brain, the only example of highly general purpose intelligence known. We distinguish two learning systems in the brain -- the first operates similar to deep learning and likely underlies most of perception while the second is a more creative system capable of generating hard-to-vary models and explanations of the world. We make contact with Popperian epistemology which suggests that the generation of scientific theories is a not an inductive process but rather an evolutionary process which proceeds through conjecture and refutation. We argue that figuring out how replicate this second system, which is capable of generating hard-to-vary explanations, is a key challenge which needs to be solved in order to realize artificial general intelligence.},

In two experiments, different groups of participants learned three virtual hedge mazes, which varied specific geometric properties (Euclidean Control Maze, Elastic Maze with stretching paths, Swap Maze with alternating paths to the same place). Spatial knowledge was then tested using three navigation tasks (metric shortcuts on empty ground plane, neighborhood shortcuts with visible boundaries, route task in corridors). They yielded the following results: (a) Metric shortcuts were insensitive to detectable shifts in target location, inconsistent with the Euclidean hypothesis. (b) Neighborhood shortcuts were constrained by visible boundaries in the Elastic Maze, but not in the Swap Maze, contrary to the Neighborhood and Constancy hypotheses. (c) The route task indicated that a graph of the maze was acquired in all environments, including knowledge of local path lengths. We conclude that primary spatial knowledge is consistent with the Cognitive Graph hypothesis. Neighborhoods are derived from the graph, and local distance and angle information is not embedded in a geometrically consistent map.},

  abstract = {During language acquisition, children follow a typical sequence of learning stages, whereby they first learn to categorize phonemes before they develop their lexicon and eventually master increasingly complex syntactic structures. However, the computational principles that lead to this learning trajectory remain largely unknown. To investigate this, we here compare the learning trajectories of deep language models to those of children. Specifically, we test whether, during its training, GPT-2 exhibits stages of language acquisition comparable to those observed in children aged between 18 months and 6 years. For this, we train 48 GPT-2 models from scratch and evaluate their syntactic and semantic abilities at each training step, using 96 probes curated from the BLiMP, Zorro and BIG-Bench benchmarks. We then compare these evaluations with the behavior of 54 children during language production. Our analyses reveal three main findings. First, similarly to children, the language models tend to learn linguistic skills in a systematic order. Second, this learning scheme is parallel: the language tasks that are learned last improve from the very first training steps. Third, some - but not all - learning stages are shared between children and these language models. Overall, these results shed new light on the principles of language acquisition, and highlight important divergences in how humans and modern algorithms learn to process natural language.},

When brake strength was manipulated between participants using a simulated braking task, the ratio of ideal to maximum deceleration at brake onset was invariant across groups, suggesting that calibration involves scaling information about ideal deceleration in intrinsic units of maximum deceleration. Evidence of rapid recalibration was found when brake strength was manipulated within participants, and the presence of external forces that affect brake dynamics resulted in biases in performance.

Later in the task, we randomly blocked the optimal path to investigate whether and how people adjust their original plans to find a detour. To this end, we developed and compared 12 different models. These models were different on how they learned and represented the environment and how they planned to catch the goal. The majority of our participants were able to plan optimally. We also showed that people were capable of revising their plans when an unexpected event occurred. The result from the model comparison showed that the model-based reinforcement learning approach provided the best account for the data and outperformed heuristics in explaining the behavioral data in the re-planning trials.},

With the high alignment between the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, a promising research direction is to employ LLMs as substitutes for humans in game experiments, enabling social science research. However, despite numerous empirical researches on the combination of LLMs and game theory, the capability boundaries of LLMs in game theory remain unclear. In this research, we endeavor to systematically analyze LLMs in the context of game theory. Specifically, rationality, as the fundamental principle of game theory, serves as the metric for evaluating players' behavior --- building a clear desire, refining belief about uncertainty, and taking optimal actions. Accordingly, we select three classical games (dictator game, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and ringnetwork game) to analyze to what extent LLMs can achieve rationality in these three aspects. The experimental results indicate that even the current state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-4) exhibits substantial disparities compared to humans in game theory. For instance, LLMs struggle to build desires based on uncommon preferences, fail to refine belief from many simple patterns, and may overlook or modify refined belief when taking actions. Therefore, we consider that introducing LLMs into game experiments in the field of social science should be approached with greater caution.},

Answering unreliably or without the necessary information prevents adoption in diverse fields, with problems including fabrication of legal precedents5 or untrue facts in news articles6 and even posing a risk to human life in medical domains such as radiology7. Encouraging truthfulness through supervision or reinforcement has~been only partially successful8. Researchers need a general method for detecting hallucinations in LLMs that works even with new and unseen questions to which humans might not know the answer. Here we develop new methods grounded in statistics, proposing entropy-based uncertainty estimators for LLMs to detect a subset of hallucinations---confabulations---which are arbitrary and incorrect generations. Our method addresses the fact that one idea can be expressed in many ways by computing uncertainty at the level of meaning rather than specific sequences of words. Our method works across datasets and tasks without a priori knowledge of the task, requires no task-specific data and robustly generalizes to new tasks not seen before. By detecting when a prompt is likely to produce a confabulation, our method helps users understand when they must take extra care with LLMs and opens up new possibilities for using LLMs that are otherwise prevented by their unreliability.},

However, their reliability becomes critical, especially when these models are exposed to misinformation. We primarily analyze the susceptibility of state-of-the-art LLMs to factual inaccuracies when they encounter false information in a QnA scenario, an issue that can lead to a phenomenon we refer to as *knowledge drift*, which significantly undermines the trustworthiness of these models. We evaluate the factuality and the uncertainty of the models' responses relying on Entropy, Perplexity, and Token Probability metrics. Our experiments reveal that an LLM's uncertainty can increase up to 56.6\% when the question is answered incorrectly due to the exposure to false information. At the same time, repeated exposure to the same false information can decrease the models uncertainty again (-52.8\% w.r.t. the answers on the untainted prompts), potentially manipulating the underlying model's beliefs and introducing a drift from its original knowledge. These findings provide insights into LLMs' robustness and vulnerability to adversarial inputs, paving the way for developing more reliable LLM applications across various domains.

This raises questions about the human-likeness of LLM-derived information, alignment with human intuition, and whether LLMs could possibly be considered (parts of) explanatory models of (aspects of) human cognition or language use. To shed more light on these issues, we here investigate the human-likeness of LLMs' predictions for multiple-choice decision tasks from the perspective of Bayesian statistical modeling. Using human data from a forced-choice experiment on pragmatic language use, we find that LLMs do not capture the variance in the human data at the item-level. We suggest different ways of deriving full distributional predictions from LLMs for aggregate, condition-level data, and find that some, but not all ways of obtaining condition-level predictions yield adequate fits to human data. These results suggests that assessment of LLM performance depends strongly on seemingly subtle choices in methodology, and that LLMs are at best predictors of human behavior at the aggregate, condition-level, for which they are, however, not designed to, or usually used to, make predictions in the first place.},

  abstract = {Medical open-domain question answering demands substantial access to specialized knowledge. Recent efforts have sought to decouple knowledge from model parameters, counteracting architectural scaling and allowing for training on common low-resource hardware. The retrieve-then-read paradigm has become ubiquitous, with model predictions grounded on relevant knowledge pieces from external repositories such as PubMed, textbooks, and UMLS. An alternative path, still under-explored but made possible by the advent of domain-specific large language models, entails constructing artificial contexts through prompting. As a result, "to generate or to retrieve" is the modern equivalent of Hamlet's dilemma. This paper presents MedGENIE, the first generate-then-read framework for multiple-choice question answering in medicine. We conduct extensive experiments on MedQA-USMLE, MedMCQA, and MMLU, incorporating a practical perspective by assuming a maximum of 24GB VRAM. MedGENIE sets a new state-of-the-art in the open-book setting of each testbed, allowing a small-scale reader to outcompete zero-shot closed-book 175B baselines while using up to 706\${\textbackslash}times\$ fewer parameters. Our findings reveal that generated passages are more effective than retrieved ones in attaining higher accuracy.},

  abstract = {We study interactive learning of LLM-based language agents based on user edits made to the agent's output. In a typical setting such as writing assistants, the user interacts with a language agent to generate a response given a context, and may optionally edit the agent response to personalize it based on their latent preference, in addition to improving the correctness. The edit feedback is naturally generated, making it a suitable candidate for improving the agent's alignment with the user's preference, and for reducing the cost of user edits over time. We propose a learning framework, PRELUDE that infers a description of the user's latent preference based on historic edit data. The inferred user preference descriptions are used to define prompts for generating responses in the future. This avoids fine-tuning the agent, which is costly, challenging to scale with the number of users, and may even degrade its performance on other tasks. Furthermore, learning descriptive preference improves interpretability, allowing the user to view and modify the learned preference. However, user preference can be complex, subtle, and vary based on context, making it challenging to learn. To address this, we propose a simple yet effective algorithm named CIPHER that leverages the LLM to infer the user preference for a given context based on user edits. In the future, CIPHER retrieves inferred preferences from the k-closest contexts in the history, and forms an aggregate preference for response generation. We introduce two interactive environments -- summarization and email writing, and use a GPT-4 simulated user for evaluation. On both tasks, CIPHER outperforms several baselines by achieving the lowest edit distance cost while only having a small overhead in LLM query cost. Our analysis reports that user preferences learned by CIPHER show significant similarity to the ground truth latent preferences.},

We gathered fifth research abstracts from five high-impact factor medical journals and asked ChatGPT to generate research abstracts based on their titles and journals. Most generated abstracts were detected using an AI output detector, `GPT-2 Output Detector', with \% `fake' scores (higher meaning more likely to be generated) of median [interquartile range] of 99.98\% `fake' [12.73\%, 99.98\%] compared with median 0.02\% [IQR 0.02\%, 0.09\%] for the original abstracts. The AUROC of the AI output detector was 0.94. Generated abstracts scored lower than original abstracts when run through a plagiarism detector website and iThenticate (higher scores meaning more matching text found). When given a mixture of original and general abstracts, blinded human reviewers correctly identified 68\% of generated abstracts as being generated by ChatGPT, but incorrectly identified 14\% of original abstracts as being generated. Reviewers indicated that it was surprisingly difficult to differentiate between the two, though abstracts they suspected were generated were vaguer and more formulaic. ChatGPT writes believable scientific abstracts, though with completely generated data. Depending on publisher-specific guidelines, AI output detectors may serve as an editorial tool to help maintain scientific standards. The boundaries of ethical and acceptable use of large language models to help scientific writing are still being discussed, and different journals and conferences are adopting varying policies.},

Recently, integrating large language models into agent-based modeling and simulation presents a promising avenue for enhancing simulation capabilities. This paper surveys the landscape of utilizing large language models in agent-based modeling and simulation, discussing their challenges and promising future directions. In this survey, since this is an interdisciplinary field, we first introduce the background of agent-based modeling and simulation and large language model-empowered agents. We then discuss the motivation for applying large language models to agent-based simulation and systematically analyze the challenges in environment perception, human alignment, action generation, and evaluation. Most importantly, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent works of large language model-empowered agent-based modeling and simulation in multiple scenarios, which can be divided into four domains: cyber, physical, social, and hybrid, covering simulation of both real-world and virtual environments, and how these works address the above challenges. Finally, since this area is new and quickly evolving, we discuss the open problems and promising future directions.

This paper introduces the Memory Sharing, a framework which integrates the real-time memory filter, storage and retrieval to enhance the In-Context Learning process. This framework allows for the sharing of memories among multiple agents, whereby the interactions and shared memories between different agents effectively enhance the diversity of the memories. The collective self-enhancement through interactive learning among multiple agents facilitates the evolution from individual intelligence to collective intelligence. Besides, the dynamically growing memory pool is utilized not only to improve the quality of responses but also to train and enhance the retriever. We evaluated our framework across three distinct domains involving specialized tasks of agents. The experimental results demonstrate that the MS framework significantly improves the agents' performance in addressing open-ended questions.},

However, LLMs differ fundamentally from humans, relying on probabilistic patterns, absent the embodied experiences or survival objectives that shape human cognition. We assess the reasoning depth of LLMs using the 11-20 money request game. Almost all advanced approaches fail to replicate human behavior distributions across many models, except in one case involving fine-tuning using a substantial amount of human behavior data. Causes of failure are diverse, relating to input language, roles, and safeguarding. These results caution against using LLMs to study human behaviors or as human surrogates.},

Through a systematic analysis of HCI papers published since 2021, we identified four key phases in the human-LLM interaction flow - planning, facilitating, iterating, and testing - to precisely understand the dynamics of this process. Additionally, we have developed a taxonomy of four primary interaction modes: Mode 1: Standard Prompting, Mode 2: User Interface, Mode 3: Context-based, and Mode 4: Agent Facilitator. This taxonomy was further enriched using the "5W1H" guideline method, which involved a detailed examination of definitions, participant roles (Who), the phases that happened (When), human objectives and LLM abilities (What), and the mechanics of each interaction mode (How). We anticipate this taxonomy will contribute to the future design and evaluation of human-LLM interaction.},

Although why or when our ancestors started returning to ``home-bases'' remains unclear, it likely had significant implications for many aspects of hominin evolution. For example, central-place foraging, by changing hunter-gatherers' use of space and mobility, could have altered social networks and increased opportunities for information exchange. We evaluated whether central-place foraging patterns facilitate information transmission and considered the potential roles of environmental conditions and mobility strategies. We built an agent-based central-place foraging model where agents move according to a simple optimal foraging rule, and can encounter other agents as they move across the environment. They either forage close to their home-bases within a given radius or move their home-bases to new areas. We analyzed the interaction networks arising across different environments and mobility strategies. We found that, at intermediate levels of environmental heterogeneity and mobility, central-place foraging increased global and local network efficiencies as well as the rate of contagion-based information transmission (simple and complex). Our findings suggest that the combination of foraging and movement strategies, as well as the underlying environmental conditions that characterized early human societies, may have been a crucial precursor in our species' unique capacity to innovate, accumulate and rely on complex culture.},

  abstract = {Search requires balancing exploring for more options and exploiting the ones previously found. Individuals foraging in a group face another trade-off: whether to engage in social learning to exploit the solutions found by others or to solitarily search for unexplored solutions. Social learning can better exploit learned information and decrease the costs of finding new resources, but excessive social learning can lead to over-exploitation and too little exploration for new solutions. We study how these two trade-offs interact to influence search efficiency in a model of collective foraging under conditions of varying resource abundance, resource density and group size. We modelled individual search strategies as L{\'e}vy walks, where a power-law exponent ({$\mu$}) controlled the trade-off between exploitative and explorative movements in individual search. We modulated the trade-off between individual search and social learning using a selectivity parameter that determined how agents responded to social cues in terms of distance and likely opportunity costs. Our results show that social learning is favoured in rich and clustered environments, but also that the benefits of exploiting social information are maximized by engaging in high levels of individual exploration. We show that selective use of social information can modulate the disadvantages of excessive social learning, especially in larger groups and when individual exploration is limited. Finally, we found that the optimal combination of individual exploration and social learning gave rise to trajectories with {$\mu$} {$\approx$} 2 and provide support for the general optimality of such patterns in search. Our work sheds light on the interplay between individual search and social learning, and has broader implications for collective search and problem-solving.},

Recent research has already applied similar paradigms to study social behavior in naturalistic conditions. We synthesize the key socio-cognitive elements involved in social foraging that can be further studied through foraging paradigms. We then propose a social foraging framework that distinguishes between the asocial and social components involved in the decision-making process and describes their integration. Our framework bridges research across disciplines to provide a promising new avenue for the study of social behavior by linking decisions across different scales, from individuals to collectives.},

Finally, we offer our perspective on the future of collective decision-making research in 3 mutually inclusive directions. We argue (1) that the possibility to collect data of a new nature, including fine-grain tracking information, virtual reality, and brain imaging inputs, will enable a direct link between plastic individual cognitive processes and the ontogeny of collective behaviors; (2) that current theoretical frameworks are not well suited to describe the long-term consequences of individual plasticity on collective decision-making processes and that, therefore, new formalisms are necessary; and finally (3) that applying the results of collective decision-making research to real-world situations will require the development of practical tools, the implementation of monitoring processes that respect civil liberties, and, possibly, government regulations of social interventions by public and private actors.},

  abstract = {Without any more delay, individuals are urged to adopt more sustainable behaviors to fight climate change. New digital systems mixed with engaging and gamification mechanisms could play an important role in achieving such an objective. In particular, Conversational Agents, like Smart Home Assistants, are a promising tool that encourage sustainable behaviors within household settings. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in enhancing the capabilities of such assistants, making them more effective in interacting with users. We present the design and implementation of GreenIFTTT, an application empowered by GPT4 to create and control home automation routines. The agent helps users understand which energy consumption optimization routines could be created and applied to make their home appliances more environmentally sustainable. We performed an exploratory study (Italy, December 2023) with N = 13 participants to test our application's usability and UX. The results suggest that GreenIFTTT is a usable, engaging, easy, and supportive tool, providing insight into new perspectives and usage of LLMs to create more environmentally sustainable home automation.},

Here, we argue that learning from AI systems resembles learning from other humans, but may be faster and more efficient. Such `hyper learning' can occur because AI: (i) provides a high signal-to-noise ratio that facilitates learning, (ii) has greater data processing ability, enabling it to generate persuasive arguments, and (iii) is perceived (in some domains) to have superior knowledge compared to humans. As a result, humans more quickly adopt biases from AI, are often more easily persuaded by AI, and exhibit novel problem-solving strategies after interacting with AI. Greater awareness of AI's influences is needed to mitigate the potential negative outcomes of human-AI interactions.},

Using a self-supervised next-word prediction task, these models generate appropriate linguistic responses in a given context. In the current study, nine participants listened to a 30-min podcast while their brain responses were recorded using electrocorticography (ECoG). We provide empirical evidence that the human brain and autoregressive DLMs share three fundamental computational principles as they process the same natural narrative: (1) both are engaged in continuous next-word prediction before word onset; (2) both match their pre-onset predictions to the incoming word to calculate post-onset surprise; (3) both rely on contextual embeddings to represent words in natural contexts. Together, our findings suggest that autoregressive DLMs provide a new and biologically feasible computational framework for studying the neural basis of language.},

Leveraging the extensive literature on intertemporal discounting for benchmarking, we examine responses from LLMs across various languages and compare them with human responses, exploring preferences between smaller, sooner and larger, later rewards. Our findings reveal that both generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models demonstrate less patience than humans, with GPT-3.5 exhibiting a lexicographic preference for earlier rewards unlike human decision makers. Although GPT-4 does not display lexicographic preferences, its measured discount rates are still considerably larger than those found in humans. Interestingly, GPT models show greater patience in languages with weak future tense references, such as German and Mandarin, aligning with the existing literature that suggests a correlation between language structure and intertemporal preferences. We demonstrate how prompting GPT to explain its decisions, a procedure we term ``chain-of-thought conjoint,'' can mitigate, but does not eliminate, discrepancies between LLM and human responses. Although directly eliciting preferences using LLMs may yield misleading results, combining chain-of-thought conjoint with topic modeling aids in hypothesis generation, enabling researchers to explore the underpinnings of preferences. Chain-of-thought conjoint provides a structured framework for marketers to use LLMs to identify potential attributes or factors that can explain preference heterogeneity across different customers and contexts.},

However, when considering recommendations from modern ``black box'' intelligent systems, users are confronted with the decision regarding when to follow or override an AI's recommendations; these decisions are even more challenging to make when there exists a significant knowledge imbalance between the users and the AI system---namely, when they lack necessary task knowledge and are therefore unable to accurately complete the task on their own. In this work, we aim to understand people's behavior in AI-assisted decision-making tasks when faced with the challenge of knowledge imbalance and explore whether involving users in an AI's prediction generation process makes them more willing to follow the AI's recommendations and enhances their perception of collaboration. Our empirical study reveals that the involvement of users in generating AI recommendations in a task with notable knowledge imbalance causes them to be more willing to agree with the AI's suggestions, to exhibit more trusting behavior toward the AI agent, and to perceive the AI agent and their collaboration as a team more positively.},

For example, the time it takes to decide can reveal more about an agent's true hidden preferences than only the decision itself. Similarly, data that track the ongoing decision process such as eye movements or neural recordings contain critical information that can be exploited, even if no decision is made. Here, we argue that artificial intelligence (AI) research would benefit from a stronger focus on insights about how decisions emerge over time and from incorporating related process data to improve AI predictions in general and human--AI interactions in particular. First, we discuss to what extent current approaches in multiagent AI do or do not incorporate process data and models of decision making. Next, we introduce a highly established computational framework that assumes decisions to emerge from the noisy accumulation of evidence, and we present related empirical work in psychology, neuroscience, and economics. Finally, we provide specific examples of how a more principled inclusion of the evidence accumulation framework into the training and use of AI can help to improve human--AI interactions in the future.},

As many---perhaps most---psychological constructs cannot be directly observed, there is a steady demand for reliable self-report scales to assess latent constructs. However, scale development is a tedious process that requires researchers to produce good items in large quantities. In this tutorial, we introduce, explain, and apply the Psychometric Item Generator (PIG), an open-source, free-to-use, self-sufficient natural language processing algorithm that produces large-scale, human-like, customized text output within a few mouse clicks. The PIG is based on the GPT-2, a powerful generative language model, and runs on Google Colaboratory---an interactive virtual notebook environment that executes code on state-of-the-art virtual machines at no cost. Across two demonstrations and a preregistered five-pronged empirical validation with two Canadian samples (NSample 1 = 501, NSample 2 = 773), we show that the PIG is equally well-suited to generate large pools of face-valid items for novel constructs (i.e., wanderlust) and create parsimonious short scales of existing constructs (i.e., Big Five personality traits) that yield strong performances when tested in the wild and benchmarked against current gold standards for assessment. The PIG does not require any prior coding skills or access to computational resources and can easily be tailored to any desired context by simply switching out short linguistic prompts in a single line of code. In short, we present an effective, novel machine learning solution to an old psychological challenge. As such, the PIG will not require you to learn a new language---but instead, speak yours.

Understanding when one does not know something is crucial for stopping the execution of inappropriate behavior and, ideally, attempting to learn more appropriate actions. From a statistical point of view, this can be translated to assessing whether none of the hypotheses in a considered set is correct. Here we investigate a novel approach for making this assessment based on monitoring the maximum a posteriori probability (MAP) of a set of candidate hypotheses as new observations arrive. Simulation studies suggest that this is a promising approach, however, we also caution that there may be cases where this is more challenging.

We aim to leverage human prediction markets with real-time machine weighting of likely higher accuracy trades to improve performance. The crowd sourced Almanis prediction market longitudinal platform (n=1822) and Next Generation Social Science (NGS2) platform (n=103) were utilised. A 43-feature model predicted top quintile relative Brier accuracy scores in two out-of-sample datasets (pboth{$<$}1{\texttimes}10-9). Trades graded as high machine accuracy quality vs. other trades had a greater AUC temporal gain from before to after trade. Hybrid human-machine forecasts had higher accuracy than human forecasts alone, particularly when the two systems disagreed by 5\% or more for binary event prediction: the hybrid system demonstrating substantial AUC gains of 13.2\%, p=1.35{\texttimes}10-14 and 13.8\%, p=0.003 in the out-of-sample Almanis B and NGS2 datasets respectively. When discordant, the hybrid model was correct for COVID-19 event occurrence 72.7\% of the time vs 27.3\% for human-only models, p=0.007. This net classification benefit was replicated in the separate Almanis B dataset, p=2.4{\texttimes}10-7. Real-time machine classification followed by weighting human trades according to likely accuracy improves collective forecasting performance. Implementation may allow improved anticipation of and response to emerging risks and improved human collective efforts generally. Significance Statement Human-machine hybrid approaches have been identified as a new frontier for event prediction and decision making in the artificial intelligence and collective human intelligence fields. For the first time, we present the successful development and validation of a human-machine hybrid prediction market approach and demonstrate its superior accuracy when compared to prediction markets based on human forecasting alone. The advantages of this new hybrid system are demonstrated in the context of COVID-19-related event prediction.},

Our work analyses the impact of task complexity on individuals and groups of different sizes while solving a goal-seeking navigation task without communication. Our major goal is to determine the effect of task complexity on performance and whether agents in a group are able to coordinate to perform the task more effectively despite the lack of communication. We developed a cognitive model of each individual agent that performs the task. We compare the performance of this agent with individual human performance, who worked on the same task. We observe that the cognitive agent is able to replicate the general behavioral trends observed in humans. Using this cognitive model, we generate groups of different sizes where individual agents work in the same goal-seeking task independently and without communication. First, we observe that increasing task complexity by design does not necessarily lead to worse performance in individuals and groups. We also observe that larger groups perform better than smaller groups and individuals alone. However, individual agents within a group perform worse than an agent working on the task alone. This effect is not the result of agents within a group covering less ground in the task compared to individuals alone. Rather, it is an effect resulting from the overlap of the agents within a group. Importantly, agents learn to reduce their overlap and improve their performance without explicit communication. These results can inform the design of AI agents in humanmachine teams.},

However, despite their considerable advancements and spread in the cognitive sciences, one can observe problems associated with the adequate presentation and understanding of some of their features. Indeed, when these models are examined from a cognitive perspective, a number of unfounded arguments tend to appear in the psychological literature. In this article, we review the most common of these arguments and discuss (a) what exactly these models represent at the implementational level and their plausibility as a cognitive theory, (b) how they deal with various aspects of meaning such as polysemy or compositionality, and (c) how they relate to the debate on embodied and grounded cognition. We identify common misconceptions that arise as a result of incomplete descriptions, outdated arguments, and unclear distinctions between theory and implementation of the models. We clarify and amend these points to provide a theoretical basis for future research and discussions on vector models of semantic representation.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as integral tools for reasoning, planning, and decision-making, drawing upon their extensive world knowledge and proficiency in language-related tasks. LLMs thus hold tremendous potential for natural language interaction within multi-agent systems to foster cooperation. However, LLM agents tend to over-report and comply with any instruction, which may result in information redundancy and confusion in multi-agent cooperation. Inspired by human organizations, this paper introduces a framework that imposes prompt-based organization structures on LLM agents to mitigate these problems. Through a series of experiments with embodied LLM agents and human-agent collaboration, our results highlight the impact of designated leadership on team efficiency, shedding light on the leadership qualities displayed by LLM agents and their spontaneous cooperative behaviors. Further, we harness the potential of LLMs to propose enhanced organizational prompts, via a Criticize-Reflect process, resulting in novel organization structures that reduce communication costs and enhance team efficiency1.},

To investigate this relationship, we conducted an online experiment in which teams made decisions supported by chatbots and employed computational methods to analyze team interaction processes. Our results indicated that compared to those assisted by chatbots in later phases, teams receiving chatbot assistance during the initial phase of their decisionmaking process exhibited increased cognitive diversity (i.e., diversity in shared information) and information elaboration (i.e., exchange and integration of information). Ultimately, teams assisted by chatbots early on performed better. These results imply that introducing AI at the beginning of the process can enhance team decision-making by promoting effective information sharing among team members.},

Humans and a specifically trained AI independently assessed the quality and quantity of ideas. We found no qualitative difference between AI and human-generated creativity, although there are differences in how ideas are generated. Interestingly, 9.4~\% of humans were more creative than the most creative GAI, GPT-4. Our findings suggest that GAIs are valuable assistants in the creative process.

Due to rapid technological advances and their extreme versatility, LLMs nowadays have millions of users and are at the cusp of being the main go-to technology for information retrieval, content generation, problem-solving, etc. Therefore, it is of great importance to thoroughly assess and scrutinize their capabilities. Due to increasingly complex and novel behavioral patterns in current LLMs, this can be done by treating them as participants in psychology experiments that were originally designed to test humans. For this purpose, the paper introduces a new field of research called "machine psychology". The paper outlines how different subfields of psychology can inform behavioral tests for LLMs. It defines methodological standards for machine psychology research, especially by focusing on policies for prompt designs. Additionally, it describes how behavioral patterns discovered in LLMs are to be interpreted. In sum, machine psychology aims to discover emergent abilities in LLMs that cannot be detected by most traditional natural language processing benchmarks.},

  abstract = {A major goal of psycholinguistic theory is to account for the cognitive constraints limiting the speed and ease of language comprehension and production. Wide-ranging evidence demonstrates a key role for linguistic expectations: A word's predictability, as measured by the information-theoretic quantity of surprisal, is a major determinant of processing difficulty. But surprisal, under standard theories, fails to predict the difficulty profile of an important class of linguistic patterns: the nested hierarchical structures made possible by recursion in human language. These nested structures are better accounted for by psycholinguistic theories of constrained working memory capacity. However, progress on theory unifying expectation-based and memory-based accounts has been limited. Here we present a unified theory of a rational trade-off between precision of memory representations with ease of prediction, a scaled-up computational implementation using contemporary machine learning methods, and experimental evidence in support of the theory's distinctive predictions. We show that the theory makes nuanced and distinctive predictions for difficulty patterns in nested recursive structures predicted by neither expectation-based nor memory-based theories alone. These predictions are confirmed 1) in two language comprehension experiments in English, and 2) in sentence completions in English, Spanish, and German. More generally, our framework offers computationally explicit theory and methods for understanding how memory constraints and prediction interact in human language comprehension and production.},

In this work, we revisit the predictive power of surprisal and entropy measures estimated from a range of language models (LMs) on data of human reading times as a measure of processing effort by incorporating information of language users' cognitive capacities. To do so, we assess the predictive power of surprisal and entropy estimated from generative LMs on reading data obtained from individuals who also completed a wide range of psychometric tests. Specifically, we investigate if modulating surprisal and entropy relative to cognitive scores increases prediction accuracy of reading times, and we examine whether LMs exhibit systematic biases in the prediction of reading times for cognitively high- or low-performing groups, revealing what type of psycholinguistic subject a given LM emulates. Our study finds that in most cases, incorporating cognitive capacities increases predictive power of surprisal and entropy on reading times, and that generally, high performance in the psychometric tests is associated with lower sensitivity to predictability effects. Finally, our results suggest that the analyzed LMs emulate readers with lower verbal intelligence, suggesting that for a given target group (i.e., individuals with high verbal intelligence), these LMs provide less accurate predictability estimates.},

The research progresses through several phases: identifying research problems, collecting baseline data on decision-making, implementing AI interventions, and evaluating the outcomes post-intervention to identify shifts in performance. The results demonstrate that GAI effectively reduces human cognitive burdens and mitigates heuristic biases by offering data-driven support and predictive analytics, grounded in System 2 reasoning. This is particularly valuable in complex situations characterized by unfamiliarity and information overload, where intuitive, System 1 thinking is less effective. However, the study also uncovers challenges related to GAI integration, such as potential over-reliance on technology, intrinsic biases particularly `out-of-the-box' thinking without contextual creativity. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative strategic framework for HI-GAI collaboration that emphasizes transparency, accountability, and inclusiveness.},

We introduce the Psychological Depth Scale (PDS), a novel framework rooted in literary theory that measures an LLM's ability to produce authentic and narratively complex stories that provoke emotion, empathy, and engagement. We empirically validate our framework by showing that humans can consistently evaluate stories based on PDS (0.72 Krippendorff's alpha). We also explore techniques for automating the PDS to easily scale future analyses. GPT-4o, combined with a novel Mixture-of-Personas (MoP) prompting strategy, achieves an average Spearman correlation of \$0.51\$ with human judgment while Llama-3-70B scores as high as 0.68 for empathy. Finally, we compared the depth of stories authored by both humans and LLMs. Surprisingly, GPT-4 stories either surpassed or were statistically indistinguishable from highly-rated human-written stories sourced from Reddit. By shifting the focus from text to reader, the Psychological Depth Scale is a validated, automated, and systematic means of measuring the capacity of LLMs to connect with humans through the stories they tell.},

Participants made classification decisions (cancerous vs. noncancerous) and confidence judgments on a series of cell images, viewing and classifying each image twice. We first examined whether it is possible to improve individual-level performance by using the maximum confidence slating (MCS) algorithm (Koriat, 2012b), which leverages metacognitive ability by using the most confident response for an image as the 'final response.' We find MCS improves individual classification accuracy for both novices and experts. Building on these results, we show that aggregation algorithms based on confidence weighting scale to larger groups of participants, dramatically improving diagnostic accuracy, with the performance of groups of novices reaching that of individual experts. In sum, we find that repeated decision-making and confidence weighting can be a valuable way to improve accuracy in medical image decision-making and that these techniques can be used in conjunction with each other.

Our participants made classification decisions (cancerous versus non-cancerous) and confidence judgments on a series of cell images, viewing and classifying each image twice. We first applied the maximum confidence slating algorithm (Koriat, 2012), which leverages metacognitive ability by using the most confident response for an image as the `final response'. We also examined algorithms that aggregated decisions based on image similarity, leveraging neural network models to determine similarity. We found maximum confidence slating improves classification accuracy for both novices and experts. However, aggregating responses on similar images improves classification accuracy for novices and not experts, suggesting differences in the decision mechanisms of novices and experts.},

  abstract = {Improving the accuracy of medical image interpretation can improve the diagnosis of numerous diseases. We compared different approaches to aggregating repeated decisions about medical images to improve the accuracy of a single decision maker. We tested our algorithms on data from both novices (undergraduates) and experts (medical professionals). Participants viewed images of white blood cells and made decisions about whether the cells were cancerous or not. Each image was shown twice to the participants and their corresponding confidence judgments were collected. The maximum confidence slating (MCS) algorithm leverages metacognitive abilities to consider the more confident response in the pair of responses as the more accurate ``final response'' (Koriat, 2012), and it has previously been shown to improve accuracy on our task for both novices and experts (Hasan et al., 2021). We compared MCS to similarity-based aggregation (SBA) algorithms where the responses made by the same participant on similar images are pooled together to generate the ``final response.'' We determined similarity by using two different neural networks where one of the networks had been trained on white blood cells and the other had not. We show that SBA improves performance for novices even when the neural network had no specific training on white blood cell images. Using an informative representation (i.e., network trained on white blood cells) allowed one to aggregate over more neighbors and further boosted the performance of novices. However, SBA failed to improve the performance for experts even with the informative representation. This difference in efficacy of the SBA suggests different decision mechanisms for novices and experts.},

The percentage t allows greater control over sensitivity and specificity and can be used to debias de- cisions.

  abstract = {Rapid advances in AI technologies have caused teams to explore the use of AI agents as full, active members of the team. The complex environments that teams occupy require human team members to constantly adapt their behaviors, and thus the ability of AI teammates to similarly adapt to changing situations significantly enhances the team's chances to succeed. In order to design such agents, it is important that we understand not only how to identify the amount of autonomous control AI agents have over their decisions, but also how changes to this control cognitively affects the rest of the team. Professional organizations often break their work cycles into phases that set limits on the team members' actions, and we propose that a similar process could be used to define the autonomy levels of AI teammates. Cyber incident response is an ideal context for this proposal, as we were able to use incident response phases to explore how a team's work cycle could guide an AI agent's changing level of autonomy. Using a mixed methods approach, we recruited 103 participants to complete a factorial survey containing ten contextual vignettes focused on an AI teammate's level of autonomy in incident response contexts, and from these participants we conducted twenty-two follow-on qualitative interviews that further explored how the participants felt an AI agent's adaptive capabilities would affect team performance and cohesiveness. Our results showed that work cycles can be used to assign autonomy levels to adaptive AI agents based upon the degree of formal processes and predictability of the team's tasks during the cycle, and that dynamic, human-like adaptation methods are vital to effective human-AI teams. This research provides significant contributions to the HCI community by proposing design recommendations for the development of adaptive autonomous teammates that both enhance Human-AI teams' productivity and promote positive team dynamics.},

But acquiring such knowledge is not always easy, especially in real-world environments where success is hidden from public view. We suggest that social inference capacities may help bridge this gap, allowing individuals to update their beliefs about others' underlying knowledge and success from observable trajectories of behaviour. We compared our social inference model against simpler heuristics in three studies of human behaviour in a collective-sensing task. Experiment 1 demonstrated that average performance improved as a function of group size at a rate greater than predicted by heuristic models. Experiment 2 introduced artificial agents to evaluate how individuals selectively rely on social information. Experiment 3 generalized these findings to a more complex reward landscape. Taken together, our findings provide insight into the relationship between individual social cognition and the flexibility of collective behaviour.},

Pairs of participants used drawings to repeatedly communicate the identity of a target object among multiple distractor objects. We manipulated social cues across three experiments and a full replication, finding that participants developed object-specific and interaction-specific strategies for communicating more efficiently over time, beyond what task practice or a resemblance-based account alone could explain. Leveraging model-based image analyses and crowdsourced annotations, we further determined that drawings did not drift toward ``arbitrariness,'' as predicted by a pure convention-based account, but preserved visually diagnostic features. Taken together, these findings advance psychological theories of how successful graphical conventions emerge.},

Our study examined their use of the Collaborative Canvas, a virtual canvas tool with integrated generative AI capabilities that we created as a probe. Participants saw value in using generative AI to assist with group facilitation and to augment perspectives and ideas. However, they worried about losing human perspectives and critical thinking, as well as reputational harms resulting from harmful AI outputs. Participants shared suggestions for appropriate ways to incorporate generative AI capabilities within multi-user applications and identified needs for transparency of content own- ership, private digital spaces, and specialized AI capabilities. Based on participants' insights, we share implications and opportunities for the incorporation of generative AI into collaborative work in ways that place user needs at the forefront.},

Human-Human (HH) teams have typically demonstrated equal Division of Labour (DoL) strategies which benefit team outcomes. However, the current understanding of DoL strategies Hybrid Human-Machine (HM) teams adopt is not well understood. We aimed to explore the DoL of HH and HM teams and understand how the DoL impacted team performance. We used an experimental platform, in which two agents work concurrently by each controlling a moving paddle to deflect falling balls. Participants were placed into either a HH team or HM team Alongside team performance, we measured DoL using sophisticated time-sensitive analyses. With these measures, we found the DoL of HH teams was more equal than HM teams and that a more equal DoL was also predictive of better team performance. Additionally, HH teams showed less redundancy in their DoL than all other conditions and less redundant DoL behaviour resulted in better team performance. These findings highlight that the there are differences in how humans Divide Labour with Machine agents. These differences are likely due to the underlying transactive nature human agents can engage in and the lack of transactive nature and coordination of HM teams. These findings highlight the need to re-evaluate current theories of Teaming Cognition and provide important basis for HM teaming practice.},

While HH teaming behaviour is sensitive to Collaborative contexts, little is known about HM teaming behaviour. Furthermore, teaming behaviour may impact the team's Joint Capacity -- the team's ability to handle teamwork processes and task demands. To assess teaming behaviour at every moment of a trial we used three distinct spatiotemporal measures (Momentary Distance, Highly Correlated Segments, and Running Correlation). To assess the team's joint performance, we adopted the Capacity Coefficient (Townsend \& Nozawa, 1995). For both HH and HM teams, behavioural measures predicted Joint Capacity. HH teams demonstrated greater performance and less synchronous behaviour than HM teams. The reduced synchrony of HH teams likely improved their performance as they could complement each other's behaviour rather than duplicate inefficiencies.},

A special case are priming effects which have been modelled successfully with error-driven learning (Marsolek, 2008), implying that participants are continuously learning during experiments. This study investigates whether trial-to-trial learning can be detected in an unprimed lexical decision experiment. We used the Discriminative Lexicon Model (DLM; Baayen et al., 2019), a model of the mental lexicon with meaning representations from distributional semantics, which models error-driven incremental learning with the Widrow-Hoff rule. We used data from the British Lexicon Project (BLP; Keuleers et al., 2012) and simulated the lexical decision experiment with the DLM on a trial-by-trial basis for each subject individually. Then, reaction times were predicted with Generalized Additive Models (GAMs), using measures derived from the DLM simulations as predictors. We extracted measures from two simulations per subject (one with learning updates between trials and one without), and used them as input to two GAMs. Learning-based models showed better model fit than the non-learning ones for the majority of subjects. Our measures also provide insights into lexical processing and individual differences. This demonstrates the potential of the DLM to model behavioural data and leads to the conclusion that trial-to-trial learning can indeed be detected in unprimed lexical decision. Our results support the possibility that our lexical knowledge is subject to continuous changes.},

However, there is no agreement as to whether this effect should be interpreted as a performance loss, consistent with other effects of distraction on driving, or as an anomalous performance gain.Method:Participants in a high-fidelity driving simulator performed a lane-keeping task in lateral wind, with instructions to keep a steady lane position. Under high load conditions, participants performed a concurrent working memory task with auditory stimuli. Cross-spectral analysis measured the relationship between wind force and steering inputs.Results:Cognitive load reduced the variability of lane position and increased the coupling between steering wheel position and crosswind strength.Conclusion:Although cognitive load disrupts driver performance in a variety of ways, it produces a performance gain in lane keeping. This effect appears to reflect drivers' efforts to protect lateral control against the risk of distraction, at the apparent neglect of other elements of driving performance.Application:Results may inform educational efforts to help drivers understand the risks of distraction and the inadequacies of compensatory driving strategies.},

Ideally, collaboration between humans and AI should lead to complementary team performance (CTP) -- a level of performance that neither of them can attain individually. So far, however, CTP has rarely been observed, suggesting an insufficient understanding of the complementary constituents in human-AI collaboration that can contribute to CTP in decision-making. This work establishes a holistic theoretical foundation for understanding and developing human-AI complementarity. We conceptualize complementarity by introducing and formalizing the notion of complementarity potential and its realization. Moreover, we identify and outline sources that explain CTP. We illustrate our conceptualization by applying it in two empirical studies exploring two different sources of complementarity potential. In the first study, we focus on information asymmetry as a source and, in a real estate appraisal use case, demonstrate that humans can leverage unique contextual information to achieve CTP. In the second study, we focus on capability asymmetry as an alternative source, demonstrating how heterogeneous capabilities can help achieve CTP. Our work provides researchers with a theoretical foundation of complementarity in human-AI decision-making and demonstrates that leveraging sources of complementarity potential constitutes a viable pathway toward effective human-AI collaboration.},

They can exploit environmental structures, co-opt complex capacities, and elude effortful search by exploiting information that automatically arrives on the mental stage. The fluency heuristic is a prime example of a heuristic that makes the most of an automatic by-product of retrieval from memory, namely, retrieval fluency. In 4 experiments, the authors show that retrieval fluency can be a proxy for real-world quantities, that people can discriminate between two objects' retrieval fluencies, and that people's inferences are in line with the fluency heuristic (in particular fast inferences) and with experimentally manipulated fluency. The authors conclude that the fluency heuristic may be one tool in the mind's repertoire of strategies that artfully probes memory for encapsulated frequency information that can veridically reflect statistical regularities in the world.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming integral to many areas of life, yet many---if not most---AI systems are opaque black boxes. This lack of transparency is a major source of concern, especially in high-stakes settings (e.g., medicine or criminal justice). The field of explainable AI (XAI) addresses this issue by explaining the decisions of opaque AI systems. However, such post hoc explanations are troubling because they cannot be faithful to what the original model computes---otherwise, there would be no need to use that black box model. A promising alternative is simple, inherently interpretable models (e.g., simple decision trees), which can match the performance of opaque AI systems. Because interpretable models represent---by design---faithful explanations of themselves, they empower informed decisions about whether to trust them. We connect research on XAI and inherently interpretable AI with that on behavioral science and boosts for competences. This perspective suggests that both interpretable AI and XAI could boost people's competences to critically evaluate AI systems and their ability to make accurate judgments (e.g., medical diagnoses) in the absence of any AI support. Furthermore, we propose how to empirically assess whether and how AI support fosters such competences. Our theoretical analysis suggests that interpretable AI models are particularly promising and---because of XAI's drawbacks---preferable. Finally, we argue that explaining large language models (LLMs) faces similar challenges as XAI for supervised machine learning and that the gist of our conjectures also holds for LLMs. (PsycInfo Database Record (c) 2024 APA, all rights reserved)},

We prompted an advanced, publicly-available LLM (GPT-4) to simulate how representative samples of Americans would respond to the stimuli from these experiments. Predictions derived from simulated responses correlate strikingly with actual treatment effects (r = 0.85), equaling or surpassing the predictive accuracy of human forecasters. Accuracy remained high for unpublished studies that could not appear in the model's training data (r = 0.90). We further assessed predictive accuracy across demographic subgroups, various disciplines, and in nine recent megastudies featuring an additional 346 treatment effects.

These models seek to infer word representations from large text collections by predicting target words from neighbouring words (or vice versa). The resulting representations are vectors in a continuous space, collectively called word embeddings. Although psychological plausibility was not a primary concern for the developers of predictive models, it has been the topic of several recent studies in the field of psycholinguistics. That is, word embeddings have been linked to similarity ratings, word associations, semantic priming, word recognition latencies, and so on. Here, we build on this work by investigating category structure. Throughout seven experiments, we sought to predict human typicality judgements from two languages, Dutch and English, using different semantic spaces. More specifically, we extracted a number of predictor variables, and evaluated how well they could capture the typicality gradient of common categories (e.g., birds, fruit, vehicles, etc.). Overall, the performance of predictive models was rather modest and did not compare favourably with that of an older count-based model. These results are somewhat disappointing given the enthusiasm surrounding predictive models. Possible explanations and future directions are discussed.},

Moreover, the test--retest reliability of ChatGPT's ratings was similar to that of human participants tested 1~day apart.

Language alongside semantic and episodic memory are proposed to have structure, as are perceptual systems. Over these structures, processes operate to construct memory and solve problems by retrieving and manipulating information. Network science offers an approach to representing cognitive structures and has made tremendous inroads into understanding the nature of cognitive structure and process. But is the mind a network? If so, what kind? In this article, we briefly review the main metaphors, assumptions, and pitfalls prevalent in cognitive network science (maps and vehicles; one network/process to rule them all), highlight the need for new metaphors that elaborate on the map-and-vehicle framework (wormholes, skyhooks, and generators), and present open questions in studying the mind as a network (the challenge of capturing network change, what should the edges of cognitive networks be made of, and aggregated vs. individual-based networks). One critical lesson of this exercise is that the richness of the mind as network approach makes it a powerful tool in its own right; it has helped to make our assumptions more visible, generating new and fascinating questions, and enriching the prospects for future research. A second lesson is that the mind as a network--though useful--is incomplete. The mind is not a network, but it may contain them.},

Additionally, previous works have shown these activities to be made up of building blocks. We focus on identifying these underlying building blocks--structural constructs, with the use of large language models. Identifying these constructs can be beneficial especially in recognizing short-duration and infrequent activities, which current systems cannot recognize. We also propose the development of an activity recognition procedure that uses these building blocks to model activities, thus helping the downstream task of activity monitoring in smart homes.},

Two aspects of human planning stand out: its efficiency, even in complex environments, and its flexibility, even in changing environments. Efficiency is especially impressive because directly computing an optimal plan is intractable, even for modestly complex tasks, and yet people successfully solve myriad everyday problems despite limited cognitive resources. Standard accounts in psychology, economics, and artificial intelligence have suggested this is because people have a mental representation of a task and then use heuristics to plan in that representation. However, this approach generally assumes that mental representations are fixed. Here, we propose that mental representations can be controlled and that this provides opportunities to adaptively simplify problems so they can be more easily reasoned about -- a process we refer to as construal. We construct a formal model of this process and, in a series of large, pre-registered behavioral experiments, show both that construal is subject to online cognitive control and that people form value-guided construals that optimally balance the complexity of a representation and its utility for planning and acting. These results demonstrate how strategically perceiving and conceiving problems facilitates the effective use of limited cognitive resources.},

Herbert Simon, with his call for models of bounded rationality, can be seen as one of the fathers of the recently initiated research program on ``simple heuristics that make us smart'' (Gigerenzer/Todd/the ABC Research Group, 1999). These heuristics perform well because they are ecologically rational: they explore the structure of environmental information and are adapted to this structure. The present review paper introduces the key concepts of this research tradition, and provides two examples: (1) The recognition heuristic, which exploits a partial lack of knowledge, and (2) Take The Best, a simple lexicographic strategy that deliberately ignores information although it is available. The paper explains their ecological rationality, provides empirical evidence of their use, and illustrates some of their applications in consumer behaviour and group decision making. Finally, this research program is related to various notions of rationality.},

However, much of this literature has studied decisions utilizing simple stimuli where the experimenter has perfect knowledge and control over stimulus properties. Here, we develop and test a new method for studying decisions involving naturalistic stimuli (medical images in this case) where the experimenter has neither perfect knowledge nor control of the stimuli properties. The central challenge in studying such decisions is to extract useful representations of images that can be associated with accumulation or drift rates in EAMs. Here, we couple a deep convolutional neural network (CNN) with the diffusion decision model (DDM) to study how expert pathologists and novices make decisions involving the classification of digital images of blood cells as either normal (non-blast) or cancerous (blast). In our approach, the CNN is the basis of a function that translates each image into a drift rate for use in the DDM. Results of fitting the joint CNN-DDM model to choice and response time data demonstrates that (1) both novices and experts demonstrated substantial speed accuracy tradeoffs, (2) both were susceptible to biases introduced by the presentation of pre-stimulus probabilistic cues, and (3) experts were more adept at extracting useful information from images than novices. These results demonstrate that this is a fruitful approach to studying decisions involving complex stimuli that will open new avenues for studying questions not possible with existing methods. Furthermore, this approach is technically feasible and has the potential to be translated into other domains of decision-making research.},

However, recent advancements in natural language processing have yielded large language models (LLMs) with exceptional abilities to identify abstract semantic attributes in text. The presented research highlights the potential application of LLMs to estimate the desirability of items, as evidenced by the re-analysis of data from 14 distinct studies. Findings indicate a significant and strong correlation between human- and machine-rated item desirability of .80, across 521 items. Results furthermore showed that the proposed fine-tuning approach of LLMs results in predictions that explained 19~\% more variance beyond that of sentiment analysis. These results demonstrate the feasibility of relying on machine-based item desirability ratings as a viable alternative to human-based ratings and contribute to the field of personality psychology by expanding the methodological toolbox available to researchers, scale developers, and practitioners.},

The uniqueness of AoT lies in its explicit requirement for varying levels of abstraction within the reasoning process. This approach could elicit language models to first contemplate on the abstract level before incorporating concrete details, which is overlooked by the prevailing step-by-step Chain-of-Thought (CoT) method. To align models with the AoT format, we present AoT Collection, a generic finetuning dataset consisting of 348k high-quality samples with AoT reasoning processes, collected via an automated and scalable pipeline. We finetune a wide range of language models with AoT Collection and conduct extensive evaluations on 23 unseen tasks from the challenging benchmark Big-Bench Hard. Experimental results indicate that models aligned to AoT reasoning format substantially outperform those aligned to CoT in many reasoning tasks.},

Experiment I compared two forms of judgment (frequency and probability estimation) over eight different kinds of observed events. Subsequently it compared subjects' predictive choice performance on selected event pairs with and without the benefit of prior estimation requirement. The results demonstrated a superiority of frequency over probability judgment and a reliable event-type influence on the quality of estimations produced. Moreover, prior judgment (frequency or probability estimation) seemed to facilitate predictive choice performance. Experiment II sought to clarify the relation between judgment and choice by manipulating the quality of prior estimations via combinations of instructional set and response requirement. Despite the differences in quality of frequency and probability judgments, choices were not directly affected by this variable. Rather, estimations served to cue frequentistic information in storage that was accumulated similarly by all experimental groups. This cuing hypothesis was tested further in Experiment III by comparing an estimation group with a directly cued group on predictive choice accuracy.

  abstract = {Conversational tones -- the manners and attitudes in which speakers communicate -- are essential to effective communication. Amidst the increasing popularization of Large Language Models (LLMs) over recent years, it becomes necessary to characterize the divergences in their conversational tones relative to humans. However, existing investigations of conversational modalities rely on pre-existing taxonomies or text corpora, which suffer from experimenter bias and may not be representative of real-world distributions for the studies' psycholinguistic domains. Inspired by methods from cognitive science, we propose an iterative method for simultaneously eliciting conversational tones and sentences, where participants alternate between two tasks: (1) one participant identifies the tone of a given sentence and (2) a different participant generates a sentence based on that tone. We run 100 iterations of this process with human participants and GPT-4, then obtain a dataset of sentences and frequent conversational tones. In an additional experiment, humans and GPT-4 annotated all sentences with all tones. With data from 1,339 human participants, 33,370 human judgments, and 29,900 GPT-4 queries, we show how our approach can be used to create an interpretable geometric representation of relations between conversational tones in humans and GPT-4. This work demonstrates how combining ideas from machine learning and cognitive science can address challenges in human-computer interactions.},

And since a robot's behavior is often a direct result of its underlying objective function, our insight is that end-users need to have an accurate mental model of this objective function in order to understand and predict what the robot will do. While people naturally develop such a mental model over time through observing the robot act, this familiarization process may be lengthy. Our approach reduces this time by having the robot model how people infer objectives from observed behavior, in order to then show those behaviors that are maximally informative. We introduce two factors to define candidate models of human inference, and show that certain models indeed produce example robot behaviors that better enable users to anticipate what it will do in novel situations. Our results also reveal that choosing the appropriate model is key, and suggest that our candidate models do not fully capture how humans extrapolate from examples of robot behavior. We leverage these findings to propose a stronger model of human learning in this setting, and conclude by analyzing the impact of different ways in which the assumed model of human learning may be incorrect.},

  abstract = {Recent advancements in large vision-language models (LVLMs) have led to significant progress in generating natural language descriptions for visual content and thus enhancing various applications. One issue with these powerful models is that they sometimes produce texts that are factually inconsistent with the visual input. While there has been some effort to mitigate such inconsistencies in natural image captioning, the factuality of generated captions for structured document images, such as charts, has not received as much scrutiny, posing a potential threat to information reliability in critical applications. This work delves into the factuality aspect by introducing a comprehensive typology of factual errors in generated chart captions. A large-scale human annotation effort provides insight into the error patterns and frequencies in captions crafted by various chart captioning models, ultimately forming the foundation of a novel dataset, CHOCOLATE. Our analysis reveals that even state-of-the-art models, including GPT-4V, frequently produce captions laced with factual inaccuracies. In response to this challenge, we establish the new task of Chart Caption Factual Error Correction and introduce CHARTVE, a model for visual entailment that outperforms proprietary and open-source LVLMs in evaluating factual consistency. Furthermore, we propose C2TFEC, an interpretable two-stage framework that excels at correcting factual errors. This work inaugurates a new domain in factual error correction for chart captions, presenting a novel evaluation mechanism, and demonstrating an effective approach to ensuring the factuality of generated chart captions.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are demonstrating remarkable capabilities across various tasks despite lacking a foundation in human cognition. This raises the question: can these models, beyond simply mimicking human language patterns, offer insights into the mechanisms underlying human cognition? This study explores the ability of ChatGPT to predict human performance in a language-based memory task. Building upon theories of text comprehension, we hypothesize that recognizing ambiguous sentences (e.g., "Because Bill drinks wine is never kept in the house") is facilitated by preceding them with contextually relevant information. Participants, both human and ChatGPT, were presented with pairs of sentences. The second sentence was always a garden-path sentence designed to be inherently ambiguous, while the first sentence either provided a fitting (e.g., "Bill has chronic alcoholism") or an unfitting context (e.g., "Bill likes to play golf"). We measured both human's and ChatGPT's ratings of sentence relatedness, ChatGPT's memorability ratings for the garden-path sentences, and humans' spontaneous memory for the garden-path sentences. The results revealed a striking alignment between ChatGPT's assessments and human performance. Sentences deemed more related and assessed as being more memorable by ChatGPT were indeed better remembered by humans, even though ChatGPT's internal mechanisms likely differ significantly from human cognition. This finding, which was confirmed with a robustness check employing synonyms, underscores the potential of generative AI models to predict human performance accurately. We discuss the broader implications of these findings for leveraging LLMs in the development of psychological theories and for gaining a deeper understanding of human cognition.},

We find that the largest models achieve high accuracy and match human error patterns: within incorrect responses, models favor literal interpretations over heuristic-based distractors. We also find preliminary evidence that models and humans are sensitive to similar linguistic cues.

We employed the Tobii eye tracker to collect the eye movement markers and reaction time data of 35 drivers. First, the road type and distances of neighboring cars were used to classify situations in the video clips into high- and low-risk situations. The revised Chinese version of the Multidimensional Driving Style Inventory (MDSI-C) was used to measure the driving style of drivers. The eye movement heatmap of drivers was used to classify the areas of interest into the front view and side mirror. We found that the angry driving style and the total fixation duration on the front view of drivers in high-risk situations were predictors of the relative lane-changing decision time. Angry-driving-style drivers' relative lane-changing decision time is shorter than that of other drivers. In high-risk driving situations, the longer the total fixation duration on the front view, the shorter the relative lane-changing decision time. We also found that the angry driving style and eye movement areas of interest interacted with the mean search durations and total fixation durations of the drivers. Angry-driving-style drivers were more focused on the front view. Our study has significance for the improvement of the improvement of the allocation of visual attention of angry-driving-style drivers and the development of advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) and connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs).},

While other methods directly read out models' probability distributions over strings, prompting requires models to access this internal information by processing linguistic input, thereby implicitly testing a new type of emergent ability: metalinguistic judgment. In this study, we compare metalinguistic prompting and direct probability measurements as ways of measuring models' linguistic knowledge. Broadly, we find that LLMs' metalinguistic judgments are inferior to quantities directly derived from representations. Furthermore, consistency gets worse as the prompt query diverges from direct measurements of next-word probabilities. Our findings suggest that negative results relying on metalinguistic prompts cannot be taken as conclusive evidence that an LLM lacks a particular linguistic generalization.

Persona prompting is most effective on data samples where disagreements among annotators are frequent yet confined to a limited range. A linear correlation exists: the more persona variables influence human annotations, the better LLMs predictions are using persona prompting. However, when the utility of persona variables is low (i.e., explaining {$<$}10\% of human annotations), persona prompting has little effect.

Unfortunately, this simple question is generally impossible to answer due to the absence of commensurability among tasks: although many taxonomies for classifying tasks have been proposed, it is not possible to say comprehensively, consistently, and quantitatively how similar or different any task is to any other. We therefore cannot in general say when we should expect to find different or similar results for teams working on different tasks. Here, we address the commensurability problem by introducing a multidimensional framework that synthesizes existing taxonomies and defines a between-task distance measure in terms of 24 taxonomic dimensions (e.g., ``degree of creativity required,'' ``amount of physical effort required,'' ``extent of demonstrable correctness''). We then use these dimensions to label 102 tasks sourced from an interdisciplinary social science literature. Finally, we use this repository of tasks to demonstrate some of the benefits of our multidimensional approach: by shedding light on the key underlying dimensions for every team task, our paradigm makes it easier to integrate ostensibly ``contradictory'' findings, identify contingencies for theories, and efficiently sample tasks for future research experiments.},

To date, it is unclear how such tools perform compared to students on university-level courses across various disciplines. Further, students' perspectives regarding the use of such tools in school work, and educators' perspectives on treating their use as plagiarism, remain unknown. Here, we compare the performance of the state-of-the-art tool, ChatGPT, against that of students on 32 university-level courses. We also assess the degree to which its use can be detected by two classifiers designed specifically for this purpose. Additionally, we conduct a global survey across five countries, as well as a more in-depth survey at the authors' institution, to discern students' and educators' perceptions of ChatGPT's use in school work. We find that ChatGPT's performance is comparable, if not superior, to that of students in a multitude of courses. Moreover, current AI-text classifiers cannot reliably detect ChatGPT's use in school work, due to both their propensity to classify human-written answers as AI-generated, as well as the relative ease with which AI-generated text can be edited to evade detection. Finally, there seems to be an emerging consensus among students to use the tool, and among educators to treat its use as plagiarism. Our findings offer insights that could guide policy discussions addressing the integration of artificial intelligence into educational frameworks.},

  abstract = {Recent advances in the performance of large language models (LLMs) have sparked debate over whether, given sufficient training, high-level human abilities emerge in such generic forms of artificial intelligence (AI). Despite the exceptional performance of LLMs on a wide range of tasks involving natural language processing and reasoning, there has been sharp disagreement as to whether their abilities extend to more creative human abilities. A core example is the ability to interpret novel metaphors. Given the enormous and non-curated text corpora used to train LLMs, a serious obstacle to designing tests is the requirement of finding novel yet high-quality metaphors that are unlikely to have been included in the training data. Here we assessed the ability of GPT-4, a state-of-the-art large language model, to provide natural-language interpretations of novel literary metaphors drawn from Serbian poetry and translated into English. Despite exhibiting no signs of having been exposed to these metaphors previously, the AI system consistently produced detailed and incisive interpretations. Human judge - blind to the fact that an AI model was involved - rated metaphor interpretations generated by GPT-4 as superior to those provided by a group of college students. In interpreting reversed metaphors, GPT-4, as well as humans, exhibited signs of sensitivity to the Gricean cooperative principle. These results indicate that LLMs such as GPT-4 have acquired an emergent ability to interpret complex novel metaphors.},

  abstract = {Advances in artificial intelligence have raised a basic question about human intelligence: Is human reasoning best emulated by applying task-specific knowledge acquired from a wealth of prior experience, or is it based on the domain-general manipulation and comparison of mental representations? We address this question for the case of visual analogical reasoning. Using realistic images of familiar three-dimensional objects (cars and their parts), we systematically manipulated viewpoints, part relations, and entity properties in visual analogy problems. We compared human performance to that of two recent deep learning models (Siamese Network and Relation Network) that were directly trained to solve these problems and to apply their task-specific knowledge to analogical reasoning. We also developed a new model using part-based comparison (PCM) by applying a domain-general mapping procedure to learned representations of cars and their component parts. Across four-term analogies (Experiment 1) and open-ended analogies (Experiment 2), the domain-general PCM model, but not the task-specific deep learning models, generated performance similar in key aspects to that of human reasoners. These findings provide evidence that human-like analogical reasoning is unlikely to be achieved by applying deep learning with big data to a specific type of analogy problem. Rather, humans do (and machines might) achieve analogical reasoning by learning representations that encode structural information useful for multiple tasks, coupled with efficient computation of relational similarity.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) are advanced artificial intelligence (AI) systems that can perform a variety of tasks commonly found in human intelligence tests, such as defining words, performing calculations, and engaging in verbal reasoning. There are also substantial individual differences in LLM capacities. Given the consistent observation of a positive manifold and general intelligence factor in human samples, along with group-level factors (e.g., crystallised intelligence), we hypothesized that LLM test scores may also exhibit positive inter-correlations, which could potentially give rise to an artificial general ability (AGA) factor and one or more group-level factors. Based on a sample of 591 LLMs and scores from 12 tests aligned with fluid reasoning (Gf), domain-specific knowledge (Gkn), reading/writing (Grw), and quantitative knowledge (Gq), we found strong empirical evidence for a positive manifold and a general factor of ability. Additionally, we identified a combined Gkn/Grw group-level factor. Finally, the number of LLM parameters correlated positively with both general factor of ability and Gkn/Grw factor scores, although the effects showed diminishing returns. We interpreted our results to suggest that LLMs, like human cognitive abilities, may share a common underlying efficiency in processing information and solving problems, though whether LLMs manifest primarily achievement/expertise rather than intelligence remains to be determined. Finally, while models with greater numbers of parameters exhibit greater general cognitive-like abilities, akin to the connection between greater neuronal density and human general intelligence, other characteristics must also be involved.},

Many prior works -- and some recently deployed defenses -- focus on "verbatim memorization", defined as a model generation that exactly matches a substring from the training set. We argue that verbatim memorization definitions are too restrictive and fail to capture more subtle forms of memorization. Specifically, we design and implement an efficient defense based on Bloom filters that perfectly prevents all verbatim memorization. And yet, we demonstrate that this "perfect" filter does not prevent the leakage of training data. Indeed, it is easily circumvented by plausible and minimally modified "style-transfer" prompts -- and in some cases even the non-modified original prompts -- to extract memorized information. For example, instructing the model to output ALL-CAPITAL texts bypasses memorization checks based on verbatim matching. We conclude by discussing potential alternative definitions and why defining memorization is a difficult yet crucial open question for neural language models.},

  abstract = {Grasping the themes of social media content is key to understanding the narratives that influence public opinion and behavior. The thematic analysis goes beyond traditional topiclevel analysis, which often captures only the broadest patterns, providing deeper insights into specific and actionable themes such as ``public sentiment towards vaccination'', ``political discourse surrounding climate policies,'' etc. In this paper, we introduce a novel approach to uncovering latent themes in social media messaging. Recognizing the limitations of the traditional topic-level analysis, which tends to capture only overarching patterns, this study emphasizes the need for a finer-grained, theme-focused exploration. Traditional theme discovery methods typically involve manual processes and a human-in-the-loop approach. While valuable, these methods face challenges in scalability, consistency, and resource intensity in terms of time and cost. To address these challenges, we propose a machine-in-the-loop approach that leverages the advanced capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs). This approach facilitates a deeper investigation into the social media discourse, revealing a variety of themes with distinct characteristics and relevance. It provides a detailed understanding of underlying nuances and efficiently maps texts to these themes, enhancing our insight into social media messaging. To demonstrate our approach, we apply our framework to contentious topics, such as climate debate and vaccine debate. We use two publicly available datasets: (1) the climate campaigns dataset of 21k Facebook ads and (2) the COVID-19 vaccine campaigns dataset of 9k Facebook ads. Our quantitative and qualitative analysis shows that our methodology yields more accurate and interpretable results compared to the baselines. Our results not only demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in uncovering latent themes but also illuminate how these themes are tailored for demographic targeting in social media contexts. Additionally, our work sheds light on the dynamic nature of social media, revealing the shifts in the thematic focus of messaging in response to real-world events.},

We summarize resources for learning both of these methods and highlight the best way to combine language analysis with more traditional psychological paradigms.

Participants evaluated their agentic and experiential capabilities and the extent to which these features are uniquely human before and after exposure to LLM responses. Post-exposure, participants increased evaluations of their agentic and experiential qualities while decreasing their perception that agency and experience are considered to be uniquely human. These results indicate that anthropomorphizing LLMs impacts attributions of mind for humans in fundamentally divergent ways: enhancing the perception of one's own mind while reducing its uniqueness for others.

While many artificial intelligence (AI) models have a neuroscience counterpart, such connections are largely missing in Transformer models and the self-attention mechanism. Here, we examine the relationship between attention heads and human episodic memory. We focus on the induction heads, which contribute to the in-context learning capabilities of Transformer-based large language models (LLMs). We demonstrate that induction heads are behaviorally, functionally, and mechanistically similar to the contextual maintenance and retrieval (CMR) model of human episodic memory. Our analyses of LLMs pre-trained on extensive text data show that CMR-like heads often emerge in the intermediate model layers and that their behavior qualitatively mirrors the memory biases seen in humans. Our findings uncover a parallel between the computational mechanisms of LLMs and human memory, offering valuable insights into both research fields.},

  abstract = {When making decisions under uncertainty, individuals often deviate from rational behavior, which can be evaluated across three dimensions: risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion. Given the widespread use of large language models (LLMs) in supporting decision-making processes, it is crucial to assess whether their behavior aligns with human norms and ethical expectations or exhibits potential biases. Although several empirical studies have investigated the rationality and social behavior performance of LLMs, their internal decisionmaking tendencies and capabilities remain inadequately understood. This paper proposes a framework, grounded in behavioral economics theories, to evaluate the decision-making behaviors of LLMs. With a multiple-choice-list experiment, we initially estimate the degree of risk preference, probability weighting, and loss aversion in a context-free setting for three commercial LLMs: ChatGPT-4.0-Turbo, Claude-3-Opus, and Gemini-1.0-pro. Our results reveal that LLMs generally exhibit patterns similar to humans, such as risk aversion and loss aversion, with a tendency to overweight small probabilities, but there are significant variations in the degree to which these behaviors are expressed across different LLMs. Further, we explore their behavior when embedded with socio-demographic features of human beings, uncovering significant disparities across various demographic characteristics. For instance, when modeled with attributes of sexual minority groups or physical disabilities, Claude-3-Opus displays increased risk aversion, leading to more conservative choices. These findings underscore the need for careful consideration of the ethical implications and potential biases in deploying LLMs in decision-making scenarios. Therefore, this study advocates for the development of standards and guidelines to ensure that LLMs operate within ethical boundaries while enhancing their utility in complex decision-making environments.},

  abstract = {Lane-change decision models with enhanced human-likeness are increasingly important as they are integral in traffic simulations for training autonomous driving algorithms. This work proposes a computational model of driver lane-change decision-making by integrating relevant human features in perception, reasoning, emotion, and decision (PRED). The PRED model describes how drivers make lane-change decisions under collision risk. Here risk is represented by probabilities and outcomes of the possible consequences. The PRED model formulates drivers' risk perception and risk propensity in its modules: the perception module is modeled with Bayesian inference; the reasoning module is modeled with Newtonian simulation; the emotion and decision module is modeled with the extended regret theory. The PRED model was fitted and tested with an empirical dataset from a naturalistic driving database. The prediction performance of the PRED model ranks higher than the selected benchmarks and is close to the state-of-the-art machine learning models. Moreover, the explicit modeling of risk propensity sheds light on an important question in transportation: what causes human drivers' risk-taking behaviors? The results support the rationale that downplaying crash consequences is the main contributor.},

We focus on customizable optimization problems that necessitate repeated solving with slight variations in modeling and are user-specific, hence posing a challenge to devising a one-size-fits-all model. We put forward a strategy that augments an LLM with an optimization solver, enhancing its proficiency in understanding and responding to user specifications and preferences while providing nonlinear reasoning capabilities. Our approach pioneers the novel concept of human-guided optimization autoformalism, translating a natural language task specification automatically into an optimization instance. This enables LLMs to analyze, explain, and tackle a variety of instance-specific energy-related problems, pushing beyond the limits of current prompt-based techniques. Our research encompasses various commonplace tasks in the energy sector, from electric vehicle charging and Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control to long-term planning problems such as cost-benefit evaluations for installing rooftop solar photovoltaics (PVs) or heat pumps. This pilot study marks an essential stride towards the context-based formulation of optimization using LLMs, with the potential to democratize optimization processes.

Adoption rates and the frequency of the usage of smart assistants vary across users and residential homes. Building on the theory of uses and gratifications (UGT) and the unified theory of acceptance and use of technology 2 (UTAUT2), the objective of this paper was to examine whether the intended use of a digital assistant would moderate the effects of performance expectancy and hedonic motivation on its adoption. Two experiments ( N = 345 and N = 351) tested the hypothesis that, for utilitarian purposes, devices with high performance appraisal are preferred, whereas for entertainment purposes, devices with high hedonic appraisal are preferred. The experiments manipulated the performance expectancy and hedonic motivation towards several digital assistants by varying how the assistants were introduced. Participants were asked which assistant they would choose for a variety of utilitarian and entertainment purposes. As expected, the experiments supported the proposed matching hypothesis, revealing that the devices that were high in performance appraisal were preferred for utilitarian tasks, whereas the devices high in hedonic appraisal were preferred for entertainment needs. These results suggest that a device's introduction can change people's perceptions of the device and subsequently their decision to use it.},

We elicit a performance baseline from human participants for each task. We use the dataset to ask whether distributional linguistic information learned by LLMs is sufficient to explain ToM in humans. We compare performance of five LLMs to a baseline of responses from human comprehenders. Results are mixed. LLMs display considerable sensitivity to mental states and match human performance in several tasks. Yet, they commit systematic errors in others, especially those requiring pragmatic reasoning on the basis of mental state information. Such uneven performance indicates that human-level ToM may require resources beyond distributional information.},

Rather than drawing direct attention to the error, tutors should guide the students to identify and correct their mistakes on their own. While tutor lessons have introduced this pedagogical skill, human evaluation of tutors applying this strategy is arduous and time-consuming. Large language models (LLMs) show promise in providing real-time assessment to tutors during their actual tutoring sessions, yet little is known regarding their accuracy in this context. In this study, we investigate the capacity of generative AI to evaluate real-life tutors' performance in responding to students making math errors. By analyzing 50 real-life tutoring dialogues, we find both GPT-3.5-Turbo and GPT-4 demonstrate proficiency in assessing the criteria related to reacting to students making errors. However, both models exhibit limitations in recognizing instances where the student made an error. Notably, GPT-4 tends to overidentify instances of students making errors, often attributing student uncertainty or inferring potential errors where human evaluators did not. Future work will focus on enhancing generalizability by assessing a larger dataset of dialogues and evaluating learning transfer. Specifically, we will analyze the performance of tutors in real-life scenarios when responding to students' math errors before and after lesson completion on this crucial tutoring skill.},

Due to its simplicity to collect, speech can be used as one of the input. The emotion information gathered from speech can be used to measure driver behavior state based on the hypothesis that emotion influences driver behavior. However, the massive amount of driving speech data may hinder optimal performance of processing and analyzing the data due to the computational complexity and time constraint. This paper presents a silence removal approach using Short Term Energy (STE) and Zero Crossing Rate (ZCR) in the pre-processing phase to reduce the unnecessary processing. Mel Frequency Cepstral Coefficient (MFCC) feature extraction method coupled with Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) classifier are employed to get the driver behavior state recognition performance. Experimental results demonstrated that the proposed approach can obtain comparable performance with accuracy ranging between 58.7\% and 76.6\% to differentiate four driver behavior states, namely; talking through mobile phone, laughing, sleepy and normal driving. It is envisaged that such approach can be extended for a more comprehensive driver behavior identification system that may acts as an embedded warning system for sleepy driver.},

To address these concerns, this study examines the influence on the diagnostic process and outcomes of interacting with an LLM compared with a human coach, and of prior training vs no training for interacting with either of these `coaches'.

  abstract = {Similar to the field of human intelligence, artificial intelligence (AI) has experienced a long history of advances and controversies regarding its definition, assessment, and application. Starting over 70 years ago, AI set out to achieve a single, general-purpose technology that could overcome many tasks in a similar fashion to humans. However, until recently, implementations were based on narrowly defined tasks, making the systems inapplicable to even slight variations of the same task. With recent advances towards more generality, the contemplation of artificial general intelligence (AGI) akin to human general intelligence (HGI) can no longer be easily dismissed. We follow this line of inquiry and outline some of the key questions and conceptual challenges that must be addressed in order to integrate AGI and HGI and to enable future progress towards a unified field of general intelligence.},

  abstract = {This paper presents novel datasets providing numerical representations of ICD-10-CM codes by generating description embeddings using a large language model followed by a dimension reduction via autoencoder. The embeddings serve as informative input features for machine learning models by capturing relationships among categories and preserving inherent context information. The model generating the data was validated in two ways. First, the dimension reduction was validated using an autoencoder, and secondly, a supervised model was created to estimate the ICD-10-CM hierarchical categories. Results show that the dimension of the data can be reduced to as few as 10 dimensions while maintaining the ability to reproduce the original embeddings, with the fidelity decreasing as the reduced-dimension representation decreases. Multiple compression levels are provided, allowing users to choose as per their requirements, download and use without any other setup. The readily available datasets of ICD-10-CM codes are anticipated to be highly valuable for researchers in biomedical informatics, enabling more advanced analyses in the field. This approach has the potential to significantly improve the utility of ICD-10-CM codes in the biomedical domain.},

Performance on an energy estimation task confirmed that energy experts have more accurate estimates of home energy use than novices. We document 24 unique expert heuristics related to device functions, components, and observable cues used by experts while making energy-use judgments. A follow-up survey with the experts indicated that these expert heuristics are generally more accurate than novice heuristics. The library of heuristics created in this study can be useful additions to education programs designed to improve public energy literacy and decision making.},

We conducted interviews with 19 qualitative researchers to understand their perspectives on this paradigm shift. Initially skeptical, researchers were surprised to see similar narratives emerge in the LLM-generated data when using the interview probe. However, over several conversational turns, they went on to identify fundamental limitations, such as how LLMs foreclose participants' consent and agency, produce responses lacking in palpability and contextual depth, and risk delegitimizing qualitative research methods. We argue that the use of LLMs as proxies for participants enacts the surrogate effect, raising ethical and epistemological concerns that extend beyond the technical limitations of current models to the core of whether LLMs fit within qualitative ways of knowing.},

In this work, we first argue that prompting on its own is insufficient to achieve good calibration and then show that fine-tuning on a small dataset of correct and incorrect answers can create an uncertainty estimate with good generalization and small computational overhead. We show that a thousand graded examples are sufficient to outperform baseline methods and that training through the features of a model is necessary for good performance and tractable for large open-source models when using LoRA. We also investigate the mechanisms that enable reliable LLM uncertainty estimation, finding that many models can be used as general-purpose uncertainty estimators, applicable not just to their own uncertainties but also the uncertainty of other models.

  abstract = {Language change is influenced by many factors, but often starts from synchronic variation, where multiple linguistic patterns or forms coexist, or where different speech communities use language in increasingly different ways. Besides regional or economic reasons, communities may form and segregate based on political alignment. The latter, referred to as political polarization, is of growing societal concern across the world. Here we map and quantify linguistic divergence across the partisan left-right divide in the United States, using social media data. We develop a general methodology to delineate (social) media users by their political preference, based on which (potentially biased) news media accounts they do and do not follow on a given platform. Our data consists of 1.5M short posts by 10k users (about 20M words) from the social media platform Twitter (now ``X''). Delineating this sample involved mining the platform for the lists of followers (n\,=\,422M) of 72 large news media accounts. We quantify divergence in topics of conversation and word frequencies, messaging sentiment, and lexical semantics of words and emoji. We find signs of linguistic divergence across all these aspects, especially in topics and themes of conversation, in line with previous research. While US American English remains largely intelligible within its large speech community, our findings point at areas where miscommunication may eventually arise given ongoing polarization and therefore potential linguistic divergence. Our flexible methodology --- combining data mining, lexicostatistics, machine learning, large language models and a systematic human annotation approach --- is largely language and platform agnostic. In other words, while we focus here on US political divides and US English, the same approach is applicable to other countries, languages, and social media platforms.},

  abstract = {The increasing capacities of large language models (LLMs) present an unprecedented opportunity to scale up data analytics in the humanities and social sciences, augmenting and automating qualitative analytic tasks previously typically allocated to human labor. This contribution goes beyond simply reporting on LLM task performance, proposing a systematic mixed methods framework to harness qualitative analytic expertise, machine scalability, and rigorous quantification, with attention to transparency and replicability. It builds on the mixed methods designs of quantitization or integration, and feature analysis from linguistics. 16 machine-assisted case studies are showcased as proof of concept, in 9 diverse languages and across multiple disciplines. Tasks include linguistic and discourse analysis, lexical semantic change detection, interview analysis, historical event cause inference, detection of political stance, text and idea reuse, genre composition in literature and film; social network inference from text, historical text mining, automated lexicography, missing metadata augmentation, and multimodal visual cultural analytics. They are based on novel test data as well as direct replications of past research. It is also shown how to replace opaque topic modeling, popular as a "distant reading" method, with hypothesis-driven topic classification. In contrast to the focus on English in the emerging LLM applicability literature, many examples here deal with scenarios involving smaller languages and historical texts prone to digitization distortions. In all but the most difficult tasks requiring expert knowledge, (already currently available) generative LLMs can demonstrably serve as viable research instruments and an alternative to human-only analytics. LLM (and human) annotations may contain errors and variation, but the agreement rate can and should be accounted for in subsequent statistical modeling; a bootstrapping approach is discussed. The replications among the case studies illustrate how tasks previously requiring potentially months of team effort and complex computational pipelines, can now be accomplished by an LLM-assisted scholar in a fraction of the time. Importantly, this approach is not intended to replace, but to augment researcher knowledge and skills. With these opportunities in sight, qualitative expertise and the ability to pose insightful questions have arguably never been more critical.},

  abstract = {Feedback is a promising strategy for energy conservation, and many energy feedback products (i.e. technologies with hardware) and platforms (i.e. technologies without hardware) have emerged on the market in recent years. Past research suggests that the effectiveness of feedback varies based on distinct characteristics, and proposes categories to better understand and distinguish between these characteristics. A review of existing categories, however, identified the following issues: (1) current structures group feedback technologies into four (or fewer) categories, making device distinction and selection onerous; (2) current categories often ignore technical and psychological distinctions of interest to researchers; and (3) none provide a systematic description of the specific characteristics that vary by category. This paper presents a classification structure of feedback technology, derived theoretically from a review of relevant literature and empirically via content analysis of 196 devices. A taxonomy structure of feedback technology was derived based on the characteristics of hardware, communications, control, display, and data collection. The resulting taxonomy included the following nine categories: (1) information platform, (2) management platform, (3) appliance monitor, (4) load monitor, (5) grid display, (6) sensor display, (7) networked sensor, (8) closed management network, and (9) open management network. These categories are mutual exclusive and exhaustive of the identified technologies collected and are based on characteristics, which are both stable and important to feedback provision. It is hoped that this feedback classification will be of use to both researchers and practitioners trying to leverage the potential of these technologies for energy conservation.},

Human judgments of similarity violate basic metric assumptions, leading to effects such as judgment asymmetry and the triangle inequality. These effects have been difficult to capture with modern geometric representations of conceptual structure such as vector embeddings. Here we introduce a similarity function related to a feature-based view of concepts. We show how this function can be applied to geometric representations and that the resulting algorithm can account for classic judgment effects. Using representations extracted from a Large Language Model, we computed the predictions of this approach to similarity relations among a set of everyday concepts (world countries), and evaluated these predictions against human judgments of similarity in a behavioral experiment. The model's predictions correlate with human judgments. These results offer insight into human judgments of similarity relations and the design of algorithms that align with human reasoning.},

However, it remains unclear whether these models have the ability to accurately infer human perceptual representations. Previous research has addressed this question by quantifying correlations between similarity response patterns of humans and LLMs. Correlation provides a measure of similarity, but it relies pre-defined item labels and does not distinguish category- and item- level similarity, falling short of characterizing detailed structural correspondence between humans and LLMs. To assess their structural equivalence in more detail, we propose the use of an unsupervised alignment method based on Gromov--Wasserstein optimal transport (GWOT). GWOT allows for the comparison of similarity structures without relying on pre-defined label correspondences and can reveal fine-grained structural similarities and differences that may not be detected by simple correlation analysis. Using a large dataset of similarity judgments of 93 colors, we compared the color similarity structures of humans (color-neurotypical and color-atypical participants) and two GPT models (GPT-3.5 and GPT-4). Our results show that the similarity structure of color-neurotypical participants can be remarkably well aligned with that of GPT-4 and, to a lesser extent, to that of GPT-3.5. These results contribute to the methodological advancements of comparing LLMs with human perception, and highlight the potential of unsupervised alignment methods to reveal detailed structural correspondences.},

It discusses the impact of LLMs across various branches of psychology, including cognitive and behavioral, clinical and counseling, educational and developmental, and social and cultural psychology, highlighting their potential to simulate aspects of human cognition and behavior. The paper delves into the capabilities of these models to emulate human-like text generation, offering innovative tools for literature review, hypothesis generation, experimental design, experimental subjects, data analysis, academic writing, and peer review in psychology. While LLMs are essential in advancing research methodologies in psychology, the paper also cautions about their technical and ethical challenges. There are issues like data privacy, the ethical implications of using LLMs in psychological research, and the need for a deeper understanding of these models' limitations. Researchers should responsibly use LLMs in psychological studies, adhering to ethical standards and considering the potential consequences of deploying these technologies in sensitive areas.

To address this problem we develop strategy discovery methods that are robust to model misspecification. Robustness is achieved by modeling model-misspecification and handling uncertainty about the real-world according to Bayesian inference. We translate our methods into an intelligent tutor that automatically discovers and teaches robust planning strategies. Our robust cognitive tutor significantly improved human decision-making when the model was so biased that conventional cognitive tutors were no longer effective.

  abstract = {An increasingly common use case for machine learning models is augmenting the abilities of human decision makers. For classification tasks where neither the human or model are perfectly accurate, a key step in obtaining high performance is combining their individual predictions in a manner that leverages their relative strengths. In this work, we develop a set of algorithms that combine the probabilistic output of a model with the class-level output of a human. We show theoretically that the accuracy of our combination model is driven not only by the individual human and model accuracies, but also by the model's confidence. Empirical results on image classification with CIFAR-10 and a subset of ImageNet demonstrate that such human-model combinations consistently have higher accuracies than the model or human alone, and that the parameters of the combination method can be estimated effectively with as few as ten labeled datapoints.},

Despite their promise, the strategic deployment of LLMs for effective utility in complex medical tasks remains an open question. Our novel framework, Medical Decision-making Agents (MDAgents) aims to address this gap by automatically assigning the effective collaboration structure for LLMs. Assigned solo or group collaboration structure is tailored to the complexity of the medical task at hand, emulating real-world medical decision making processes. We evaluate our framework and baseline methods with state-of-the-art LLMs across a suite of challenging medical benchmarks: MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, PMC-VQA, Path-VQA, and MedVidQA, achieving the best performance in 5 out of 7 benchmarks that require an understanding of multi-modal medical reasoning. Ablation studies reveal that MDAgents excels in adapting the number of collaborating agents to optimize efficiency and accuracy, showcasing its robustness in diverse scenarios. We also explore the dynamics of group consensus, offering insights into how collaborative agents could behave in complex clinical team dynamics.

  abstract = {Heating and cooling (HC) energy use is responsible for about 42\% of the total annual energy consumption of the average household in the U.S and it is significantly affected by residents' energy-related behavior. In this paper, our goal is to realize a new paradigm for energy-aware communities that leverages smart eco-feedback devices and social games to engage residents in understanding and reducing their home HC energy use. Towards this goal, we present a new sociotechnical modeling approach based on utility theory to reveal causal effects in human decision-making and infer attributes affecting the thermostat adjustment behavior of each household during an eco-feedback intervention. Our approach 1) is based on a utility model that quantifies residents' preferences over indoor temperatures given decision attributes related to their thermal environment and eco-feedback design and 2) incorporates latent parameters that determine the unique behavioral characteristics of each household. For parameter learning, we develop a hierarchical Bayesian model with non-centered parameterization calibrated using field data collected from a multi-unit residential community located in Fort Wayne, IN. The dataset comprises two parts; a baseline period without any behavioral intervention, and an intervention period, where personalized eco-feedback and social games are deployed through resident engagement devices with smart thermostat control capabilities, including a wall-mounted tablet and smart speaker. Through the model calibration, we quantify the impact of the eco-feedback on households' thermostat-adjustment behaviors. We propose that the utility model developed in this work can serve as the foundation for analyzing resident behavior in connected residential communities with eco-feedback energy-saving programs.},

  abstract = {Widely deployed large language models (LLMs) can produce convincing yet incorrect outputs, potentially misleading users who may rely on them as if they were correct. To reduce such overreliance, there have been calls for LLMs to communicate their uncertainty to end users. However, there has been little empirical work examining how users perceive and act upon LLMs' expressions of uncertainty. We explore this question through a large-scale, pre-registered, human-subject experiment (N=404) in which participants answer medical questions with or without access to responses from a fictional LLM-infused search engine. Using both behavioral and self-reported measures, we examine how different natural language expressions of uncertainty impact participants' reliance, trust, and overall task performance. We find that first-person expressions (e.g., "I'm not sure, but...") decrease participants' confidence in the system and tendency to agree with the system's answers, while increasing participants' accuracy. An exploratory analysis suggests that this increase can be attributed to reduced (but not fully eliminated) overreliance on incorrect answers. While we observe similar effects for uncertainty expressed from a general perspective (e.g., "It's not clear, but..."), these effects are weaker and not statistically significant. Our findings suggest that using natural language expressions of uncertainty may be an effective approach for reducing overreliance on LLMs, but that the precise language used matters. This highlights the importance of user testing before deploying LLMs at scale.},

From the data generated by GPT, we identify its (revealed) preferences and explore its ability to learn from data. Our analysis yields three results. First, GPT's choices are consistent with (expected) utility maximization theory. Second, GPT can align its recommendations with people's risk aversion, by recommending less risky portfolios to more risk-averse decision makers, highlighting GPT's potential as a personalized decision aid. Third, however, GPT demonstrates limited alignment when it comes to disappointment aversion.},

In more natural communication, however, human speech is unconstrained, often describing goals (e.g., "make it cozy in here" or "help me save energy") rather than indicating specific target devices and actions to take on those devices. Current systems fail to understand these under-specified commands since they cannot reason about devices and settings as they relate to human situations. We introduce large language models (LLMs) to this problem space, exploring their use for controlling devices and creating automation routines in response to under-specified user commands in smart homes. We empirically study the baseline quality and failure modes of LLM-created action plans with a survey of age-diverse users. We find that LLMs can reason creatively to achieve challenging goals, but they experience patterns of failure that diminish their usefulness. We address these gaps with Sasha, a smarter smart home assistant. Sasha responds to loosely-constrained commands like "make it cozy" or "help me sleep better" by executing plans to achieve user goals---e.g., setting a mood with available devices, or devising automation routines. We implement and evaluate Sasha in a hands-on user study, showing the capabilities and limitations of LLM-driven smart homes when faced with unconstrained user-generated scenarios.},

Voice assistants aim to solve this problem by providing a natural language interface to devices, yet such assistants cannot understand loosely-constrained commands, they lack the ability to reason about and explain devices' behaviors to users, and they rely on connectivity to intrusive cloud infrastructure. Toward addressing these issues, we propose thoughtful things: devices that leverage lightweight, on-device language models to take actions and explain their behaviors in response to unconstrained user commands. We propose an end-to-end framework that leverages formal modeling, automated training data synthesis, and generative language models to create devices that are both capable and thoughtful in the presence of unconstrained user goals and inquiries. Our framework requires no labeled data and can be deployed on-device, with no cloud dependency.

To address this, with the development of large language models (LLMs), some researchers have recently attempted to develop simulated economic experiments using LLMs-driven agents, called generative agents. If generative agents can replicate human-like decision-making in economic experiments, the cost problem of economic experiments can be alleviated. However, such a simulation framework has not been yet established. Considering the previous research and the current evolutionary stage of LLMs, this study focuses on the reasoning ability of generative agents as a key factor toward establishing a framework for such a new methodology. A multi-agent simulation, designed to improve the reasoning ability of generative agents through prompting methods, was developed to reproduce the result of an actual economic experiment on the ultimatum game. The results demonstrated that the higher the reasoning ability of the agents, the closer the results were to the theoretical solution than to the real experimental result. The results also suggest that setting the personas of the generative agents may be important for reproducing the results of real economic experiments. These findings are valuable for the future definition of a framework for replacing human participants with generative agents in economic experiments when LLMs are further developed.},

These models have led to unprecedented accuracy over most computerized language processing tasks, from web searches to automatic machine translation and question answering, while their dialogue-based forms, like ChatGPT have captured the interest of over a million users. The success of the large language model is mostly attributed to its capability to numerically represent words in their context, long a weakness of previous attempts to automate psychological assessment from language. While potential applications for automated therapy are beginning to be studied on the heels of chatGPT's success, here we present evidence that suggests, with thorough validation of targeted deployment scenarios, that AI's newest technology can move mental health assessment away from rating scales and to instead use how people naturally communicate, in language.},

The tutorial describes methods for analyzing text, providing functions with reliable defaults that can be used off-the-shelf as well as providing a framework for the advanced users to build on for novel pipelines. The reader learns about three core methods: (1) textEmbed(): to transform text to modern transformer-based word embeddings; (2) textTrain() and textPredict(): to train predictive models with embeddings as input, and use the models to predict from; (3) textSimilarity() and textDistance(): to compute semantic similarity/distance scores between texts.

For each experiment, participants completed a speeded length judgment task with a reliable but imperfect aid. Participants demonstrated serial processing of information and likely used only one source of information when making decisions across all conditions. Integrating information on the display and accurate training were shown to lead to more efficient information processing. Display characteristics, performance incentives, and training play a role in how people use information from the automated aids which may lead to slow downs or speed ups in information processing. This research sheds light on how people gather and process information with an automation aid and suggests how we might design systems to improve decision performance.},

However, humans can drive in diverse scenarios. Can we find an underlying principle from which driving behaviour in different scenarios emerges? We propose the Driver's Risk Field (DRF), a two-dimensional field that represents the driver's belief about the probability of an event occurring. The DRF, when multiplied with the consequence of the event, provides an estimate of the driver's perceived risk. Through human-in-the-loop and computer simulations, we show that human-like driving behaviour emerges when the DRF is coupled to a controller that maintains the perceived risk below a threshold-level. The DRF model predictions concur with driving behaviour reported in literature for seven different scenarios (curve radii, lane widths, obstacle avoidance, roadside furniture, car-following, overtaking, oncoming traffic). We conclude that our generalizable DRF model is scientifically satisfying and has applications in automated vehicles.},

This paper introduces a human-like steering model, in which the driver adapts to the risk due to uncertainty in the environment. Current steering models take a risk-neutral approach, while the fields of economics and sensorimotor control suggest that humans exhibit risk-sensitive behavior. The proposed model uses a risk-sensitive optimal feedback control structure to predict steering behavior. The paper studies the effect of the risk-sensitivity parameter and compares the prediction of the risk-neutral and risk-sensitive controllers in a simulated abstraction of two scenarios: (a) driving while being subjected to lateral wind gusts and (b) overtaking an unpredictably swerving car. The simulation results show that the risk-sensitive model adapts to the uncertainty in the environment. Experimental data will be needed to validate the predictions of our model.},

In two experiments, we train several LMs---ranging from very simple n-gram models to state-of-the-art deep neural networks---on written cross-linguistic corpus data covering 1293 different languages and statistically estimate learning difficulty. Using a variety of quantitative methods and machine learning techniques to account for phylogenetic relatedness and geographical proximity of languages, we show that there is robust evidence for a relationship between learning difficulty and speaker population size. However, contrary to expectations derived from previous research, our results suggest that languages with more speakers tend to be harder to learn.},

  abstract = {Assessing an AI system's behavior-particularly in Explainable AI Systems-is sometimes done empirically, by measuring people's abilities to predict the agent's next move-but how to perform such measurements? In empirical studies with humans, an obvious approach is to frame the task as binary (i.e., prediction is either right or wrong), but this does not scale. As output spaces increase, so do floor effects, because the ratio of right answers to wrong answers quickly becomes very small. The crux of the problem is that the binary framing is failing to capture the nuances of the different degrees of "wrongness." To address this, we begin by proposing three mathematical bases upon which to measure "partial wrongness." We then uses these bases to perform two analyses on sequential decision-making domains: the first is an in-lab study with 86 participants on a size-36 action space; the second is a re-analysis of a prior study on a size-4 action space. Other researchers adopting our operationalization of the prediction task and analysis methodology will improve the rigor of user studies conducted with that task, which is particularly important when the domain features a large output space.},

We know what features are predictive of collective intelligence in human groups, but we do not understand the specific mechanisms that lead to the emergence of this distributed information processing ability. In contrast, there is a well-developed literature of experiments that have exposed the mechanisms of collective intelligence in nonhuman animal species. We adapt a recent experiment designed to study collective sensing in groups of fish in order to better understand the mechanisms that may underly the emergence of collective intelligence in human groups. We find that humans in our experiments act at a high level like fish but with two additional behaviors: independent exploration and targeted copying. These distinctively human activities may partially explain the emergence of collective sensing in our task environment at group sizes and on times scales orders of magnitudes smaller than were observed in fish.},

Previous work showed that distance estimations are consistently biased when no direct route is available to the queried target or when participants follow a detour. Here we investigated whether a corresponding bias is manifested in two other popular measures of survey knowledge: a pointing task and a sketchmapping task. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a systematic bias in pointing/sketchmapping performance associated with the preferred route choice in an applied urban setting. The results were mixed. We found moderate evidence for the presence of a systematic bias, but only for a subset of urban locations. When two plausible routes to the target were available, survey knowledge estimates were significantly biased in the direction of the route chosen by the participant. When only one plausible route was available, we did not find a statistically significant pattern. The results may have methodological implications for spatial cognition studies in applied urban settings that might be obtaining systematically biased survey knowledge estimates at some urban locations. Researchers should be aware that the choice of urban locations from which pointing and sketchmapping are performed might systematically distort the results, in particular when two plausible but diverging routes to the target are visible from the location.},

  abstract = {Humans routinely make inferences about both the contents and the workings of other minds based on observed actions. People consider what others want or know, but also how intelligent, rational, or attentive they might be. Here, we introduce a new methodology for quantitatively studying the mechanisms people use to attribute intelligence to others based on their behavior. We focus on two key judgments previously proposed in the literature: judgments based on observed outcomes (you're smart if you won the game), and judgments based on evaluating the quality of an agent's planning that led to their outcomes (you're smart if you made the right choice, even if you didn't succeed). We present a novel task, the Maze Search Task (MST), in which participants rate the intelligence of agents searching a maze for a hidden goal. We model outcome-based attributions based on the observed utility of the agent upon achieving a goal, with higher utilities indicating higher intelligence, and model planning-based attributions by measuring the proximity of the ob- served actions to an ideal planner, such that agents who produce closer approximations of optimal plans are seen as more intelligent. We examine human attributions of intelligence in 3 experiments that use MST, and find that participants used both outcome and planning as indicators of intelli- gence. However, observing outcome was not necessary, and participants still made planning-based attributions of intelligence when the outcome was not observed. We also found that the weights individuals placed on planning and on outcome correlated with an individual's ability to engage in cognitive reflection. Our work demonstrates that it is possible to computationally model how people attribute intelligence based on the extent to which an agent makes good choices.},

Existing paradigms for studying search in humans focus on its isolated aspects, such as step-by-step information sampling or visual search, without examining advance planning. We propose and evaluate a Bayesian model of how people search in a naturalistic maze-solving task. The model encodes environment exploration as a sequential process of acquiring information modelled by a Partially Observable Markov Decision Process (POMDP), which maximises the information gained. We show that the search policy averaged across participants is optimal. Individual solutions, however, are highly variable and can be explained by two heuristics: thinking and guessing. Self-report and inference using a Gaussian Mixture Model over inverse POMDP consistently assign most subjects to one style or the another. By analysing individual participants' decision times during the task we show that individuals often solve partial POMDPs and plan their search a limited number of steps in advance.},

  abstract = {Advice-taking plays a critical role in collaboration. Yet people tend to under-utilize advice, often to their own detriment. In this chapter, we investigate if people's utilization of advice improves when they know the advisor has access to different information compared to them. Across four experiments, we examine how individuals integrate advice in an estimation task, where the advisee and the advisor have access to different perspectives of the same problem. Experiment 1 evaluates participants' independent ability to perform the task of estimating the number of objects in a jar from various viewpoints. The results show that depending on the type of objects, some viewpoints provide more accurate estimates than others. Experiment 2 confirms that participants are able to identify these more informative viewpoints. Building on these findings, Experiment 3 examines how individuals adjust their estimates when presented with estimates from a human advisor and an AI advisor. Individuals are also given information about the advisor's perspective. Our findings are consistent with egocentric discounting where individuals exhibit a general bias toward their own information. However, this discounting is lower for AI advisors compared to human advisors in our experiment. Our results also show that the advisor's estimate is taken more into account when the advisor has a more favorable viewpoint -- for both human and AI advisors. This suggests a potential for optimizing advice-taking behavior by enhancing people's understanding of the advisor's viewpoint. This study furthers our understanding of advice-taking dynamics with human and AI advisors and the role of perspective-taking in decision-making processes.},

  abstract = {Collaboration with other agents requires people to reflect on several aspects of their collaborator's capabilities: How good are they at a task? Do they have access to the same information as I do? How useful is their advice? This dissertation takes a closer look at how people answer these questions while interacting with other humans and more importantly, with AI agents. First, we discuss the role of mental models in facilitating people's interactions with other agents. In Chapter 2, we present a computational framework to understand how people assess the ability of other humans and AI agents. Our research reveals a discrepancy in people's assessments: individuals accurately gauge another human's ability on a task, but consistently overestimate an AI agent's performance on the same task. In Chapter 3, we examine how people navigate advice when a human or an AI advisor has access to different information than they do. We find that while people take into account this difference in information, they consistently underestimate the value of advice. Finally, in Chapter 4, using two case studies we demonstrate the utility of cognitive modeling in inferring people's latent reliance on AI. The first case study models people's decision to accept advice, and the second case study models people's decision to intervene in the AI's course of action. We conclude by discussing avenues for future work. Altogether, this dissertation uses a cognitive science lens to improve our understanding of human-AI interaction, highlighting the role of mental models and drawing valuable lessons from human-human interaction.},

  abstract = {Conceptual spaces represent entities in terms of their primitive semantic features. Such representations are highly valuable but they are notoriously difficult to learn, especially when it comes to modelling perceptual and subjective features. Distilling conceptual spaces from Large Language Models (LLMs) has recently emerged as a promising strategy. However, existing work has been limited to probing pre-trained LLMs using relatively simple zero-shot strategies. We focus in particular on the task of ranking entities according to a given conceptual space dimension. Unfortunately, we cannot directly fine-tune LLMs on this task, because ground truth rankings for conceptual space dimensions are rare. We therefore use more readily available features as training data and analyse whether the ranking capabilities of the resulting models transfer to perceptual and subjective features. We find that this is indeed the case, to some extent, but having perceptual and subjective features in the training data seems essential for achieving the best results. We furthermore find that pointwise ranking strategies are competitive against pairwise approaches, in defiance of common wisdom.},

These agents are widely deployed in a variety of settings, with potential impact on users. However, the study of social interactions with agents powered by LLM is still emerging, limited by access to the technology and to data, the absence of standardised interfaces, and challenges to establishing controlled experimental setups using the currently available business-oriented platforms. To answer these gaps, we developed LEXI, LLMs Experimentation Interface, an open-source tool enabling the deployment of artificial agents powered by LLM in social interaction behavioural experiments. Using a graphical interface, LEXI allows researchers to build agents, and deploy them in experimental setups along with forms and questionnaires while collecting interaction logs and self-reported data. The outcomes of usability testing indicate LEXI's broad utility, high usability and minimum mental workload requirement, with distinctive benefits observed across disciplines. A proof-of-concept study exploring the tool's efficacy in evaluating social HAIs was conducted, resulting in high-quality data. A comparison of empathetic versus neutral agents indicated that people perceive empathetic agents as more social, and write longer and more positive messages towards them.},

  abstract = {The rise of generative artificial intelligence (AI) has ignited a debate about its effects on the mis- and disinformation landscape. The doomsday scenarios of epistemic and information apocalypse presented for many years are recently being questioned, and the previous fears are called ``overblown.'' These phenomena are analyzed mostly through the factors of quantity and quality of AI-powered content and the potential for personalization possessed by AI. We argue that using quantitative arguments carries a high risk of underestimating the threat, especially in the context of the so-called detection challenge. We point out that this discourse is affected by the narrow conceptualization of how we understand quantity, quality, and personalization with regard to AI. In our opinion, apocalyptic visions are speculative in nature, difficult to quantify, and carry signs of a self-fulfilling prophecy, but disregarding risks hinders appropriate countermeasures against AI-powered dis- and misinformation, which adversely affects policy-making activities. We propose a paradigm shift to focus more on social reactions to technology rather than technological attributes. By expanding the understanding of the analyzed phenomena, we indicate that the potential of AI is both overestimated and underestimated and above all---still misunderstood.

  abstract = {AI systems are adopted in numerous domains due to their increas- ingly strong predictive performance. However, in high-stakes domains such as criminal justice and healthcare, full automation is often not desirable due to safety, ethical, and legal concerns, yet fully manual approaches can be inaccurate and time-consuming. As a result, there is growing interest in the research community to augment human decision making with AI assistance. Besides developing AI technologies for this purpose, the emerging field of human-AI decision making must embrace empirical approaches to form a foundational understanding of how humans interact and work with AI to make decisions. To invite and help structure research efforts towards a science of understanding and improving human-AI decision making, we survey recent literature of empirical human-subject studies on this topic. We summarize the study design choices made in over 100 papers in three important aspects: (1) decision tasks, (2) AI assistance elements, and (3) evaluation metrics. For each aspect, we summarize current trends, discuss gaps in current practices of the field, and make a list of recommendations for future research. Our work highlights the need to develop com- mon frameworks to account for the design and research spaces of human-AI decision making, so that researchers can make rigorous choices in study design, and the research community can build on each other's work and produce generalizable scientific knowledge. We also hope this work will serve as a bridge for HCI and AI communities to work together to mutually shape the empirical science and computational technologies for human-AI decision making.},

We therefore investigate whether explanations of few-shot examples can help LMs. We annotate questions from 40 challenging tasks with answer explanations, and various matched control explanations. We evaluate how different types of explanations, instructions, and controls affect zero- and few-shot performance. We analyze these results using statistical multilevel modeling techniques that account for the nested dependencies among conditions, tasks, prompts, and models. We find that explanations can improve performance -- even without tuning. Furthermore, explanations hand-tuned for performance on a small validation set offer substantially larger benefits, and building a prompt by selecting examples and explanations together substantially improves performance over selecting examples alone. Finally, even untuned explanations outperform carefully matched controls, suggesting that the benefits are due to the link between an example and its explanation, rather than lower-level features. However, only large models benefit. In summary, explanations can support the in-context learning of large LMs on challenging tasks.},

  abstract = {Abstract reasoning is a key ability for an intelligent system. Large language models (LMs) achieve above-chance performance on abstract reasoning tasks but exhibit many imperfections. However, human abstract reasoning is also imperfect. Human reasoning is affected by our real-world knowledge and beliefs, and shows notable ``content effects''; humans reason more reliably when the semantic content of a problem supports the correct logical inferences. These content-entangled reasoning patterns are central to debates about the fundamental nature of human intelligence. Here, we investigate whether language models---whose prior expectations capture some aspects of human knowledge---similarly mix content into their answers to logic problems. We explored this question across three logical reasoning tasks: natural language inference, judging the logical validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. We evaluate state of the art LMs, as well as humans, and find that the LMs reflect many of the same qualitative human patterns on these tasks---like humans, models answer more accurately when the semantic content of a task supports the logical inferences. These parallels are reflected in accuracy patterns, and in some lower-level features like the relationship between LM confidence over possible answers and human response times. However, in some cases the humans and models behave differently---particularly on the Wason task, where humans perform much worse than large models, and exhibit a distinct error pattern. Our findings have implications for understanding possible contributors to these human cognitive effects, as well as the factors that influence language model performance.},

  abstract = {What can be learned about causality and experimentation from passive data? This question is salient given recent successes of passively-trained language models in interactive domains such as tool use. Passive learning is inherently limited. However, we show that purely passive learning can in fact allow an agent to learn generalizable strategies for determining and using causal structures, as long as the agent can intervene at test time. We formally illustrate that learning a strategy of first experimenting, then seeking goals, can allow generalization from passive learning in principle. We then show empirically that agents trained via imitation on expert data can indeed generalize at test time to infer and use causal links which are never present in the training data; these agents can also generalize experimentation strategies to novel variable sets never observed in training. We then show that strategies for causal intervention and exploitation can be generalized from passive data even in a more complex environment with high-dimensional observations, with the support of natural language explanations. Explanations can even allow passive learners to generalize out-of-distribution from perfectly-confounded training data. Finally, we show that language models, trained only on passive next-word prediction, can generalize causal intervention strategies from a few-shot prompt containing examples of experimentation, together with explanations and reasoning. These results highlight the surprising power of passive learning of active causal strategies, and may help to understand the behaviors and capabilities of language models.},

  abstract = {The rapid integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the workforce is quickly transforming the nature of workforce teams and collaborative work, leading to the emergence of Human-AI Teams (HATs). This dissertation explores the complexities of HATs, focusing on their unique dynamics and the necessity for specialized integration strategies, namely HAT team training. Unlike traditional teams, HATs combine human creativity, intuition, and decision-making with AI's computational prowess and data-processing capabilities, offering significant opportunities for innovation and efficiency in the workplace. Central to the effective functioning of HATs is the need to align human expectations with AI's capabilities and bridge knowledge gaps between human and AI teammates. This dissertation identifies key challenges in integrating AI into teams, including developing shared mental models, addressing skill-set limitations, and overcoming negative perceptions of AI. These aspects necessitate specialized considerations for their successful integration into HATs. In traditional human-human teams, training is a valuable tool for supporting team preparation and integration of any kind, pivotal to the future success of any team. Consequently, examining and designing training for HATs becomes a logical area for exploration to support effective integration. However, existing efforts in this domain have been scant and often limited in scope and under the assumption that human-human teaming principles can be directly applied to HATs. Such an approach overlooks AI's nuanced role as a teammate as opposed to a mere technological tool. This oversight has led to a substantial gap in understanding how team training strategies, successful in human-human contexts, can be effectively adapted and tailored for HATs; further, this has limited the direct design and evaluation of HAT-specific training programs. The lack of a thorough exploration of HAT-specific training approaches makes the seamless integration of HATs into the workforce more daunting and complex. Given these warrants, this dissertation explores the journey towards these aims, helping workforces to leverage the benefits of HATs better and examining how Study 3 evaluates the effectiveness of HAT team training in an applied organizational setting seeking to integrate HATs into workflows. Building on insights from the first two studies--- the need for HAT team training emphasizing teamwork and AI understanding (i.e., Study 1) and the effectiveness of tailored cross-training in enhancing knowledge and attitudes toward HATs (i.e., Study 2)---this study tested novel HAT team training strategies. The HAT Integration Training focused on AI situational awareness, effective communication, and understanding human-AI interdependencies. Using a mixed-methods embedded design, the study employed focus groups, observations, and pre-post-training comparisons to evaluate the training outcomes when working with an internal AI teammate. It demonstrated gains in objective and subjective performance and key changes in workplace trust facilitated by critical awareness and reframed expectations. Clear boundary setting, practical and actionable communication strategies, and positional modeling and examples contributed to the training's effectiveness. Additionally, the study revealed a clear need and demand for greater HAT training related to their use cases, secure and ethical AI use, and alignment with organizational resources. This was paired with an increased desire to adopt AI teammates and support measures (e.g., training) for organizational, professional, and personal purposes. This study provides valuable insights into the applicability of HAT team training methods for AI integration and bridges the gap between theoretical research and practical implementation of HATs. These three studies fill a currently understudied research gap in human-AI teaming, focusing on how HAT team training can set appropriate expectations and support an understanding of AI that can work to ease the integration of HATs in the workforce. Each study in this disseration offers recommendations for investigating and instituting HAT team training, addressing crucial gaps in the current literature and practice. This dissertation's contributions are poised to address a need for more research in the HAT field, offering approaches for future research and practical applications. As AI continues to reshape the workplace, the insights from this research will be instrumental in guiding organizations toward a future where human and AI collaboration can be effectively supported and molded for its most significant impact.},

  abstract = {Legislation and ethical guidelines around the globe call for effective human oversight of AI-based systems in high-risk contexts -- that is oversight that reliably reduces the risks otherwise associated with the use of AI-based systems. Such risks may relate to the imperfect accuracy of systems (e.g., inaccurate classifications) or to ethical concerns (e.g., unfairness of outputs). Given the significant role that human oversight is expected to play in the operation of AI-based systems, it is crucial to better understand the conditions for effective human oversight. We argue that the reliable detection of errors (as an umbrella term for inaccuracies and unfairness) is crucial for effective human oversight. We then propose that Signal Detection Theory (SDT) offers a promising framework for better understanding what affects people's sensitivity (i.e., how well they are able to detect errors) and response bias (i.e., the tendency to report errors given a perceived evidence of an error) in detecting errors. Whereas an SDT perspective on the detection of inaccuracies is straightforward, we demonstrate its broader applicability by detailing the specifics for an SDT perspective on unfairness detection, including the need to choose a standard for (un)fairness. Additionally, we illustrate that an SDT perspective helps to better understand the conditions for effective error detection by showing examples of task-, system-, and person-related factors that may affect the sensitivity and response bias of humans tasked with detecting unfairness associated with the use of AI-based systems. Finally, we discuss future research directions for an SDT perspective on error detection.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}Human performance in natural environments is deeply impressive, and still much beyond current AI. Experimental techniques, such as eye tracking, may be useful to understand the cognitive basis of this performance, and ``the human advantage.'' Driving is domain where these techniques may deployed, in tasks ranging from rigorously controlled laboratory settings through high-fidelity simulations to naturalistic experiments in the wild. This research has revealed robust patterns that can be reliably identified and replicated in the field and reproduced in the lab. The purpose of this review is to cover the basics of what is known about these gaze behaviors, and some of their implications for understanding visually guided steering. The phenomena reviewed will be of interest to those working on any domain where visual guidance and control with similar task demands is involved (e.g., many sports). The paper is intended to be accessible to the non-specialist, without oversimplifying the complexity of real-world visual behavior. The literature reviewed will provide an information base useful for researchers working on oculomotor behaviors and physiology in the lab who wish to extend their research into more naturalistic locomotor tasks, or researchers in more applied fields (sports, transportation) who wish to bring aspects of the real-world ecology under experimental scrutiny. Part of a Research Topic on Gaze Strategies in Closed Self-paced tasks, this aspect of the driving task is discussed. It is in particular emphasized why it is important to carefully separate the visual strategies driving (quite closed and self-paced) from visual behaviors relevant to other forms of driver behavior (an open-ended menagerie of behaviors). There is always a balance to strike between ecological complexity and experimental control. One way to reconcile these demands is to look for natural, real-world tasks and behavior that are rich enough to be interesting yet sufficiently constrained and well-understood to be replicated in simulators and the lab. This {$<$}italic{$>$}ecological approach{$<$}/italic{$>$} to driving as a model behavior and the way the connection between ``lab'' and ``real world'' can be spanned in this research is of interest to anyone keen to develop more ecologically representative designs for studying human gaze behavior.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A challenge for this idea, which we call bibliotechnism, is that LLMs generate novel text. We begin with a defense of bibliotechnism, showing how even novel text may inherit its meaning from original human-generated text. We then argue that bibliotechnism faces an independent challenge from examples in which LLMs generate novel reference, using new names to refer to new entities. Such examples could be explained if LLMs were not cultural technologies but had beliefs, desires, and intentions. According to interpretationism in the philosophy of mind, a system has such attitudes if and only if its behavior is well explained by the hypothesis that it does. Interpretationists may hold that LLMs have attitudes, and thus have a simple solution to the novel reference problem. We emphasize, however, that interpretationism is compatible with very simple creatures having attitudes and differs sharply from views that presuppose these attitudes require consciousness, sentience, or intelligence (topics about which we make no claims).},

While scholarly efforts have demonstrated LLMs' propensity to reproduce biases in their training data, they have primarily focused on the association of social groups with stereotypic attributes. In this paper, we extend this line of inquiry to investigate a bias akin to the social-psychological phenomenon where socially dominant groups are perceived to be less homogeneous than socially subordinate groups as it is reproduced by LLMs. We had ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art LLM, generate a diversity of texts about intersectional group identities and compared text homogeneity. We consistently find that LLMs portray African, Asian, and Hispanic Americans as more homogeneous than White Americans. They also portray women as more homogeneous than men, but these differences are small. Finally, we find that the effect of gender differs across racial/ethnic groups such that the effect of gender is consistent within African and Hispanic Americans but not within Asian and White Americans. We speculate possible sources of this bias in LLMs and posit that the bias has the potential to amplify biases in future LLM training and to reinforce stereotypes.},

  abstract = {In building instruction-tuned large language models (LLMs), the importance of a deep understanding of human knowledge can be often overlooked by the importance of instruction diversification. This research proposes a novel approach to instruction tuning by integrating a structured cognitive learning methodology that takes inspiration from the systematic progression and cognitively stimulating nature of human education through two key steps. First, our synthetic instruction data generation pipeline, designed with some references to human educational frameworks, is enriched with meta-data detailing topics and cognitive rigor for each instruction. Specifically, our generation framework is infused with questions of varying levels of rigorousness, inspired by Bloom's Taxonomy, a classic educational model for structured curriculum learning. Second, during instruction tuning, we curate instructions such that questions are presented in an increasingly complex manner utilizing the information on question complexity and cognitive rigorousness produced by our data generation pipeline. Our human-inspired curriculum learning yields significant performance enhancements compared to uniform sampling or round-robin, improving MMLU by 3.06 on LLaMA 2. We conduct extensive experiments and find that the benefits of our approach are consistently observed in eight other benchmarks. We hope that our work will shed light on the post-training learning process of LLMs and its similarity with their human counterpart.},

  abstract = {In real-world vision, people prioritise the most informative scene regions via eye-movements. According to the cognitive guidance theory of visual attention, viewers allocate visual attention to those parts of the scene that are expected to be the most informative. The expected information of a scene region is coded in the semantic distribution of that scene. Meaning maps have been proposed to capture the spatial distribution of local scene semantics in order to test cognitive guidance theories of attention. Notwithstanding the success of meaning maps, the reason for their success has been contested. This has led to at least two possible explanations for the success of meaning maps in predicting visual attention. On the one hand, meaning maps might measure scene semantics. On the other hand, meaning maps might measure scene features, overlapping with, but distinct from, scene semantics. This study aims to disentangle these two sources of information by considering both conceptual information and non-semantic scene entropy simultaneously. We found that both semantic and non-semantic information is captured by meaning maps, but scene entropy accounted for more unique variance in the success of meaning maps than conceptual information. Additionally, some explained variance was unaccounted for by either source of information. Thus, although meaning maps may index some aspect of semantic information, their success seems to be better explained by non-semantic information. We conclude that meaning maps may not yet be a good tool to test cognitive guidance theories of attention in general, since they capture non-semantic aspects of local semantic density and only a small portion of conceptual information. Rather, we suggest that researchers should better define the exact aspect of cognitive guidance theories they wish to test and then use the tool that best captures that desired semantic information. As it stands, the semantic information contained in meaning maps seems too ambiguous to draw strong conclusions about how and when semantic information guides visual attention.},

This integration enhances Large Language Models' ability to mimic human perception, allowing them to process image inputs. Despite VLMs' advanced capabilities, however, there is a concern that VLMs inherit biases of both modalities in ways that make biases more pervasive and difficult to mitigate. Our study explores how VLMs perpetuate homogeneity bias and trait associations with regards to race and gender. When prompted to write stories based on images of human faces, GPT-4V describes subordinate racial and gender groups with greater homogeneity than dominant groups and relies on distinct, yet generally positive, stereotypes. Importantly, VLM stereotyping is driven by visual cues rather than group membership alone such that faces that are rated as more prototypically Black and feminine are subject to greater stereotyping. These findings suggest that VLMs may associate subtle visual cues related to racial and gender groups with stereotypes in ways that could be challenging to mitigate. We explore the underlying reasons behind this behavior and discuss its implications and emphasize the importance of addressing these biases as VLMs come to mirror human perception.},

  abstract = {As Large Language Models (LLMs) are nondeterministic, the same input can generate different outputs, some of which may be incorrect or hallucinated. If run again, the LLM may correct itself and produce the correct answer. Unfortunately, most LLM-powered systems resort to single results which, correct or not, users accept. Having the LLM produce multiple outputs may help identify disagreements or alternatives. However, it is not obvious how the user will interpret conflicts or inconsistencies. To this end, we investigate how users perceive the AI model and comprehend the generated information when they receive multiple, potentially inconsistent, outputs. Through a preliminary study, we identified five types of output inconsistencies. Based on these categories, we conducted a study ({$N$} = 252) in which participants were given one or more LLMgenerated passages to an information-seeking question. We found that inconsistency within multiple LLM-generated outputs lowered the participants' perceived AI capacity, while also increasing their comprehension of the given information. Specifically, we observed that this positive effect of inconsistencies was most significant for participants who read two passages, compared to those who read three. Based on these findings, we present design implications that, instead of regarding LLM output inconsistencies as a drawback, we can reveal the potential inconsistencies to transparently indicate the limitations of these models and promote critical LLM usage.},

Therefore, we use the recently proposed Task2Vec diversity coefficient to ground and understand formal aspects of data quality, to go beyond scale alone. Specifically, we measure the diversity coefficient of publicly available pre-training datasets to demonstrate that their formal diversity is high when compared to theoretical lower and upper bounds. In addition, to build confidence in the diversity coefficient, we conduct interpretability experiments and find that the coefficient aligns with intuitive properties of diversity, e.g., it increases as the number of latent concepts increases. We conclude the diversity coefficient is reliable, show it's high for publicly available LLM datasets, and conjecture it can be used to build useful diverse datasets for LLMs.},

We systematically probed the capabilities of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 across four central components of the scientific process: as a Research Librarian, Research Ethicist, Data Generator, and Novel Data Predictor, using psychological science as a testing field. In Study 1 (Research Librarian), unlike human researchers, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 hallucinated, authoritatively generating fictional references 36.0\% and 5.4\% of the time, respectively, although GPT-4 exhibited an evolving capacity to acknowledge its fictions. In Study 2 (Research Ethicist), GPT-4 (though not GPT-3.5) proved capable of detecting violations like p-hacking in fictional research protocols, correcting 88.6\% of blatantly presented issues, and 72.6\% of subtly presented issues. In Study 3 (Data Generator), both models consistently replicated patterns of cultural bias previously discovered in large language corpora, indicating that ChatGPT can simulate known results, an antecedent to usefulness for both data generation and skills like hypothesis generation. Contrastingly, in Study 4 (Novel Data Predictor), neither model was successful at predicting new results absent in their training data, and neither appeared to leverage substantially new information when predicting more vs. less novel outcomes. Together, these results suggest that GPT is a flawed but rapidly improving librarian, a decent research ethicist already, capable of data generation in simple domains with known characteristics but poor at predicting novel patterns of empirical data to aid future experimentation.},

Exploration of many but sparsely-distributed patterns in multiscale visualizations is challenging as visual representations change across zoom levels, context and navigational cues get lost upon zooming, and navigation is time consuming. Our technique visualizes annotated patterns too small to be identifiable at certain zoom levels using insets, i.e., magnified thumbnail views of the annotated patterns. Insets support users in searching, comparing, and contextualizing patterns while reducing the amount of navigation needed. They are dynamically placed either within the viewport or along the boundary of the viewport to offer a compromise between locality and context preservation. Annotated patterns are interactively clustered by location and type. They are visually represented as an aggregated inset to provide scalable exploration within a single viewport. In a controlled user study with 18 participants, we found that Scalable Insets can speed up visual search and improve the accuracy of pattern comparison at the cost of slower frequency estimation compared to a baseline technique. A second study with 6 experts in the field of genomics showed that Scalable Insets is easy to learn and provides first insights into how Scalable Insets can be applied in an open-ended data exploration scenario.},

However, human reliance on the AI's assistance is often sub-optimal --- with people exhibiting under- or over-reliance on the AI.

We analyze the participants' reliance on AI assistance and the accuracy of human-AI assistance as compared to the human or AI working independently. We demonstrate that participants do not show automation bias which is a widely reported behavior displayed by humans when assisted by AI. In this specific instance of AI-assisted decision-making, people are able to correctly override the AI's decision when needed and achieve close to the theoretical upper bound on combined performance. We suggest that the reason for this discrepancy from previous research findings is because 1) people are experts at classifying everyday images and have a good understanding of their ability in performing the task, 2) people engage in the metacognitive act of deliberation when asked to indicate confidence in their decision, and 3) people were able to build a good mental model of the AI by incorporating feedback that was provided after each trial.

Recent social science research has explored the use of these ``black-box'' LLM agents for simulating complex social systems and potentially substituting human subjects in experiments. Our study delves into this emerging domain, investigating the extent to which LLMs exhibit key social interaction principles, such as social learning, social preference, and cooperative behavior (indirect reciprocity), in their interactions with humans and other agents. We develop a framework for our study, wherein classical laboratory experiments involving human subjects are adapted to use LLM agents. This approach involves step-by-step reasoning that mirrors human cognitive processes and zero-shot learning to assess the innate preferences of LLMs. Our analysis of LLM agents' behavior includes both the primary effects and an in-depth examination of the underlying mechanisms. Focusing on GPT-4, our analyses suggest that LLM agents appear to exhibit a range of human-like social behaviors such as distributional and reciprocity preferences, responsiveness to group identity cues, engagement in indirect reciprocity, and social learning capabilities. However, our analysis also reveals notable differences: LLMs demonstrate a pronounced fairness preference, weaker positive reciprocity, and a more calculating approach in social learning compared to humans. These insights indicate that while LLMs hold great promise for applications in social science research, such as in laboratory experiments and agent-based modeling, the subtle behavioral differences between LLM agents and humans warrant further investigation. Careful examination and development of protocols in evaluating the social behaviors of LLMs are necessary before directly applying these models to emulate human behavior.},

These AI chatbots can respond to questions by generating verbal instructions similar to those a person would provide during the problem-solving process. Aim: ChatGPT has become the fastest growing software in terms of user adoption in history, leading to an anticipated widespread use of this technology in the general population. Current literature is predominantly focused on the functional aspects of these technologies, but the field has not yet explored hypotheses on how these AI chatbots could impact the evolutionary aspects of human cognitive development. Thesis: The 'neuronal recycling hypothesis' posits that the brain undergoes structural transformation by incorporating new cultural tools into 'neural niches,' consequently altering individual cognition. In the case of technological tools, it has been established that they reduce the cognitive demand needed to solve tasks through a process called 'cognitive offloading.' In this theoretical article, three hypotheses were proposed via forward inference about how algorithms such as ChatGPT and similar models may influence the cognitive processes and structures of upcoming generations. Conclusions: By forecasting the neurocognitive effects of these technologies, educational and political communities can anticipate future scenarios and formulate strategic plans to either mitigate or enhance the cognitive influence that these factors may have on the general population.

This begs the question: how do ViTs attempt to perform tasks that require computing visual relations between objects? Prior efforts to interpret ViTs tend to focus on characterizing relevant low-level visual features. In contrast, we adopt methods from mechanistic interpretability to study the higher-level visual algorithms that ViTs use to perform abstract visual reasoning. We present a case study of a fundamental, yet surprisingly difficult, relational reasoning task: judging whether two visual entities are the same or different. We find that pretrained ViTs fine-tuned on this task often exhibit two qualitatively different stages of processing despite having no obvious inductive biases to do so: 1) a perceptual stage wherein local object features are extracted and stored in a disentangled representation, and 2) a relational stage wherein object representations are compared. In the second stage, we find evidence that ViTs can learn to represent somewhat abstract visual relations, a capability that has long been considered out of reach for artificial neural networks. Finally, we demonstrate that failure points at either stage can prevent a model from learning a generalizable solution to our fairly simple tasks. By understanding ViTs in terms of discrete processing stages, one can more precisely diagnose and rectify shortcomings of existing and future models.},

  abstract = {Academic texts often define a given concept using words. Across texts, definitions may represent the same or different meanings of the given concept, especially for concepts in interdisciplinary fields, such as cognitive science. Understanding the variability of definitions and the reasons for this variability may facilitate the replicability of science: variations in concept definitions may indicate or provoke a heterogeneous understanding of the concept, leading to differences between studies in the methodology and, subsequently, the results. We developed proxy measures of the variability in definitions of each concept using information theory and natural language processing (i.e., entropy, KL divergence, and lexical diversity). We collected and analyzed 2212 definitions of 216 concepts associated with "open scholarship" as a use case study. We found strong correlations between the entropy-based proxy measures and the number of definitions and unique words yielded by concepts. However, we found no correlation between lexical diversity and the entropy-based proxies. This indicates that concepts that yield definitions with different wordings in the literature (high on lexical diversity) do not necessarily reflect an inconsistent understanding of concepts' meaning across contexts (high on the entropy-based measures). The proposed methodology can help identify concepts that yield heterogeneous definitions in academic texts and concepts that are consistently defined in a semi-automated manner.},

  abstract = {Empirical software engineering research on production systems has brought forth a better understanding of the software engineering process for practitioners and researchers alike. However, only a small subset of production systems is studied, limiting the impact of this research. While software engineering practitioners benefit from replicating research on their own data, this poses its own set of challenges, since performing replications requires a deep understanding of research methodologies and subtle nuances in software engineering data. Given that large language models (LLMs), such as GPT-4, show promise in tackling both software engineering- and science-related tasks, these models could help democratize empirical software engineering research. In this paper, we examine LLMs' abilities to perform replications of empirical software engineering research on new data. We specifically study their ability to surface assumptions made in empirical software engineering research methodologies, as well as their ability to plan and generate code for analysis pipelines on seven empirical software engineering papers. We perform a user study with 14 participants with software engineering research expertise, who evaluate GPT-4-generated assumptions and analysis plans (i.e., a list of module specifications) from the papers. We find that GPT-4 is able to surface correct assumptions, but struggle to generate ones that reflect common knowledge about software engineering data. In a manual analysis of the generated code, we find that the GPT-4-generated code contains the correct high-level logic, given a subset of the methodology. However, the code contains many small implementation-level errors, reflecting a lack of software engineering knowledge. Our findings have implications for leveraging LLMs for software engineering research as well as practitioner data scientists in software teams.},

A promising way to overcome this problem is to detect driver distraction and adapt in-vehicle systems accordingly to mitigate such distractions. To realize this strategy, this paper applied support vector machines (SVMs), which is a data mining method, to develop a real-time approach for detecting cognitive distraction using drivers' eye movements and driving performance data. Data were collected in a simulator experiment in which ten participants interacted with an IVIS while driving. The data were used to train and test both SVM and logistic regression models, and three different model characteristics were investigated: how distraction was defined, which data were input to the model, and how the input data were summarized. The results show that the SVM models were able to detect driver distraction with an average accuracy of 81.1\%, outperforming more traditional logistic regression models. The best performing model (96.1\% accuracy) resulted when distraction was defined using experimental conditions (i.e., IVIS drive or baseline drive), the input data were comprised of eye movement and driving measures, and these data were summarized over a 40-s window with 95\% overlap of windows. These results demonstrate that eye movements and simple measures of driving performance can be used to detect driver distraction in real time. Potential applications of this paper include the design of adaptive in-vehicle systems and the evaluation of driver distraction},

We have reached a pivotal moment for ensuring that LLMs and LLM-infused applications are developed and deployed responsibly. However, a central pillar of responsible AI -- transparency -- is largely missing from the current discourse around LLMs. It is paramount to pursue new approaches to provide transparency for LLMs, and years of research at the intersection of AI and human-computer interaction (HCI) highlight that we must do so with a human-centered perspective: Transparency is fundamentally about supporting appropriate human understanding, and this understanding is sought by different stakeholders with different goals in different contexts. In this new era of LLMs, we must develop and design approaches to transparency by considering the needs of stakeholders in the emerging LLM ecosystem, the novel types of LLM-infused applications being built, and the new usage patterns and challenges around LLMs, all while building on lessons learned about how people process, interact with, and make use of information. We reflect on the unique challenges that arise in providing transparency for LLMs, along with lessons learned from HCI and responsible AI research that has taken a human-centered perspective on AI transparency. We then lay out four common approaches that the community has taken to achieve transparency -- model reporting, publishing evaluation results, providing explanations, and communicating uncertainty -- and call out open questions around how these approaches may or may not be applied to LLMs. We hope this provides a starting point for discussion and a useful roadmap for future research.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of AI-based decision aids, different forms of AI assistance have been increasingly integrated into the human decision making processes. To best support humans in decision making, it is essential to quantitatively understand how diverse forms of AI assistance influence humans' decision making behavior. To this end, much of the current research focuses on the end-to-end prediction of human behavior using ``black-box'' models, often lacking interpretations of the nuanced ways in which AI assistance impacts the human decision making process. Meanwhile, methods that prioritize the interpretability of human behavior predictions are often tailored for one specific form of AI assistance, making adaptations to other forms of assistance difficult. In this paper, we propose a computational framework that can provide an interpretable characterization of the influence of different forms of AI assistance on decision makers in AI-assisted decision making. By conceptualizing AI assistance as the ``\{{\textbackslash}em nudge\}'' in human decision making processes, our approach centers around modelling how different forms of AI assistance modify humans' strategy in weighing different information in making their decisions. Evaluations on behavior data collected from real human decision makers show that the proposed framework outperforms various baselines in accurately predicting human behavior in AI-assisted decision making. Based on the proposed framework, we further provide insights into how individuals with different cognitive styles are nudged by AI assistance differently.},

  abstract = {People's reliance on suboptimal heuristics gives rise to a plethora of cognitive biases in decision-making including the present bias, which denotes people's tendency to be overly swayed by an action's immediate costs/benefits rather than its more important long-term consequences. One approach to helping people overcome such biases is to teach them better decision strategies. But which strategies should we teach them? And how can we teach them effectively? Here, we leverage an automatic method for discovering rational heuristics and insights into how people acquire cognitive skills to develop an intelligent tutor that teaches people how to make better decisions. As a proof of concept, we derive the optimal planning strategy for a simple model of situations where people fall prey to the present bias. Our cognitive tutor teaches people this optimal planning strategy by giving them metacognitive feedback on how they plan in a 3-step sequential decision-making task. Our tutor's feedback is designed to maximally accelerate people's metacognitive reinforcement learning towards the optimal planning strategy. A series of four experiments confirmed that training with the cognitive tutor significantly reduced present bias and improved people's decision-making competency: Experiment 1 demonstrated that the cognitive tutor's feedback can help participants discover far-sighted planning strategies. Experiment 2 found that this training effect transfers to more complex environments. Experiment 3 found that these transfer effects are retained for at least 24 hours after the training. Finally, Experiment 4 found that practicing with the cognitive tutor can have additional benefits over being told the strategy in words. The results suggest that promoting metacognitive reinforcement learning with optimal feedback is a promising approach to improving the human mind.},

In this article, 306 published papers are reviewed, and 21 studies are identified to determine the challenges and potential for the development of gamification strategies to improve building energy efficiency. Specifically, this work reviews the implementation techniques of gamification and methods to assess the impact of gamification mechanisms on human energy behavior changes. This analysis demonstrates that, firstly, the choice of an optimal gamification implementation method should be inherently attuned to the distinct characteristics of the building type and its occupants. Secondly, it is imperative to strike a judicious balance between extrinsic and intrinsic motivations, in which customization of gamification design elements are based on users' unique personality traits and preferences, to properly tailor gamification mechanisms. Thirdly, integrating a fusion of quantification of energy savings and qualitative interpretation of user behaviors to improve the energy efficiency in buildings is essential for a more holistic understanding of the impact of gamification on users' energy-related behavior change. The findings indicate that gamification techniques can enable the effective reduction of energy consumption in buildings.},

Current approaches, primarily relying on numerical models, face challenges in spatial-temporal resolution and in capturing the dynamic interplay of environmental, social, and behavioral factors affecting heat risks. This has led to difficulties in translating risk assessments into effective mitigation actions. Recognizing these problems, we introduce a novel approach leveraging the burgeoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract rich and contextual insights from news reports. We hence propose an LLM-empowered visual analytics system, Havior, that integrates the precise, data-driven insights of numerical models with nuanced news report information. This hybrid approach enables a more comprehensive assessment of heat risks and better identification, assessment, and mitigation of heat-related threats. The system incorporates novel visualization designs, such as ``thermoglyph'' and news glyph, enhancing intuitive understanding and analysis of heat risks. The integration of LLM-based techniques also enables advanced information retrieval and semantic knowledge extraction that can be guided by experts' analytics needs. Our case studies on two cities that faced significant heatwave events and interviews with five experts have demonstrated the usefulness of our system in providing in-depth and actionable insights for heat risk management.},

However, unsupervised models output representation vectors, the elements of which are not good candidates to explain because they lack semantic meaning. To bridge this gap, recent works defined a scalar explanation output: a dot product-based similarity in the representation space to the sample being explained (i.e., an explicand). Although this enabled explanations of unsupervised models, the interpretation of this approach can still be opaque because similarity to the explicand's representation may not be meaningful to humans. To address this, we propose contrastive corpus similarity, a novel and semantically meaningful scalar explanation output based on a reference corpus and a contrasting foil set of samples. We demonstrate that contrastive corpus similarity is compatible with many post-hoc feature attribution methods to generate COntrastive COrpus Attributions (COCOA) and quantitatively verify that features important to the corpus are identified. We showcase the utility of COCOA in two ways: (i) we draw insights by explaining augmentations of the same image in a contrastive learning setting (SimCLR); and (ii) we perform zero-shot object localization by explaining the similarity of image representations to jointly learned text representations (CLIP).},

  abstract = {In the field of psychology, traditional assessment methods, such as standardized scales, are frequently critiqued for their static nature, lack of personalization, and reduced participant engagement, while comprehensive counseling evaluations are often inaccessible. The complexity of quantifying psychological traits further limits these methods. Despite advances with large language models (LLMs), many still depend on single-round Question-and-Answer interactions. To bridge this gap, we introduce PsyDI, a personalized and progressively in-depth chatbot designed for psychological measurements, exemplified by its application in the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator (MBTI) framework. PsyDI leverages user-related multi-modal information and engages in customized, multi-turn interactions to provide personalized, easily accessible measurements, while ensuring precise MBTI type determination. To address the challenge of unquantifiable psychological traits, we introduce a novel training paradigm that involves learning the ranking of proxy variables associated with these traits, culminating in a robust score model for MBTI measurements. The score model enables PsyDI to conduct comprehensive and precise measurements through multi-turn interactions within a unified estimation context. Through various experiments, we validate the efficacy of both the score model and the PsyDI pipeline, demonstrating its potential to serve as a general framework for psychological measurements. Furthermore, the online deployment of PsyDI has garnered substantial user engagement, with over 3,000 visits, resulting in the collection of numerous multi-turn dialogues annotated with MBTI types, which facilitates further research.

However, their application in strategic multi-agent decision-making environments is hampered by significant limitations including poor mathematical reasoning, difficulty in following instructions, and a tendency to generate incorrect information. These deficiencies hinder their performance in strategic and interactive tasks that demand adherence to nuanced game rules, long-term planning, exploration in unknown environments, and anticipation of opponents' moves. To overcome these obstacles, this paper presents a novel LLM agent framework equipped with memory and specialized tools to enhance their strategic decision-making capabilities. We deploy the tools in a number of economically important environments, in particular bilateral bargaining and multi-agent and dynamic mechanism design. We employ quantitative metrics to assess the framework's performance in various strategic decision-making problems. Our findings establish that our enhanced framework significantly improves the strategic decision-making capability of LLMs. While we highlight the inherent limitations of current LLM models, we demonstrate the improvements through targeted enhancements, suggesting a promising direction for future developments in LLM applications for interactive environments.},

However, there is an ongoing debate about how and when transformers can acquire highly structured behavior and achieve systematic generalization. Here, we explore how well a causal transformer can perform a set of algorithmic tasks, including copying, sorting, and hierarchical compositions of these operations. We demonstrate strong generalization to sequences longer than those used in training by replacing the standard positional encoding typically used in transformers with labels arbitrarily paired with items in the sequence. We search for the layer and head configuration sufficient to solve these tasks, then probe for signs of systematic processing in latent representations and attention patterns. We show that two-layer transformers learn reliable solutions to multi-level problems, develop signs of task decomposition, and encode input items in a way that encourages the exploitation of shared computation across related tasks. These results provide key insights into how attention layers support structured computation both within a task and across multiple tasks.},

Existing methods for achieving this alignment often involves employing reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) to fine-tune LLMs based on human labels assessing the relative quality of model responses. Nevertheless, RLHF is susceptible to instability during fine-tuning and presents challenges in implementation.Drawing inspiration from the emerging field of representation engineering (RepE), this study aims to identify relevant representations for high-level human preferences embedded in patterns of activity within an LLM, and achieve precise control of model behavior by transforming its representations. This novel approach, denoted as Representation Alignment from Human Feedback (RAHF), proves to be effective, computationally efficient, and easy to implement.Extensive experiments demonstrate the efficacy of RAHF in not only capturing but also manipulating representations to align with a broad spectrum of human preferences or values, rather than being confined to a singular concept or function (e.g. honesty or bias). RAHF's versatility in accommodating diverse human preferences shows its potential for advancing LLM performance.},

We propose a probabilistic framework that combines the predictions of humans and AI based on the quality of the information given by both agents. We apply this framework to a regression task in which humans and AI are given different views of a jar and aim to estimate the number of objects in it. We demonstrate that our model can outperform methods that ignore information asymmetry. Furthermore, we show that complementarity can be achieved, i.e., combining human and AI predictions leads to better performance than relying on humans or AI alone. This framework can be adapted to solve other problems in which different sources of information from multiple agents are present.},

  abstract = {A human-like following vehicle (FV) model for lane-changing scenario was developed. First, the non-linear relationship between FV responses and relative speed was integrated. Normalized transformation was performed to better investigate the correlation characteristics between variables. Second, environmental factors and kinematic parameters were characterized using a hierarchical linear model. Next, vehicle control modes were incorporated. Finally, a human-like response model (HRM) for the FV was proposed and tested. It is found that the brake intensity of the FV is affected by lane-changing direction, but it is not affected by turn-signal usage or traffic density. Turn-signal usage and traffic density are related to kinematic parameters. Lane-changers use their turn signal more when relative velocity is negative or when traffic density is high. Therefore, turn-signal usage and traffic density will become redundant variables when kinematic parameters are considered. Driving data verification shows that the HRM can match both non-critical and critical lane-changing cases and can simulate the no reaction behavior of the FV in lane-changing, which can help to improve the human-like driving ability of intelligent vehicles.},

However, people's decisions are not always rational, so the implicit internal models of human decision-making in Large Language Models (LLMs) must account for this. Previous empirical evidence seems to suggest that these implicit models are accurate --- LLMs offer believable proxies of human behavior, acting how we expect humans would in everyday interactions. However, by comparing LLM behavior and predictions to a large dataset of human decisions, we find that this is actually not the case: when both simulating and predicting people's choices, a suite of cutting-edge LLMs (GPT-4o \& 4-Turbo, Llama-3-8B \& 70B, Claude 3 Opus) assume that people are more rational than we really are. Specifically, these models deviate from human behavior and align more closely with a classic model of rational choice --- expected value theory. Interestingly, people also tend to assume that other people are rational when interpreting their behavior. As a consequence, when we compare the inferences that LLMs and people draw from the decisions of others using another psychological dataset, we find that these inferences are highly correlated. Thus, the implicit decision-making models of LLMs appear to be aligned with the human expectation that other people will act rationally, rather than with how people actually act.},

In this paper, we explore whether we can quantitatively model how humans integrate both AI recommendations and explanations into their decision process, and whether this quantitative understanding of human behavior from the learned model can be utilized to manipulate AI explanations, thereby nudging individuals towards making targeted decisions. Our extensive human experiments across various tasks demonstrate that human behavior can be easily influenced by these manipulated explanations towards targeted outcomes, regardless of the intent being adversarial or benign.

These methods generally assume the selection process captures similarities between the exemplar and the target instance, however, it remains unknown what kinds of similarities are captured and vital to performing ICL. To dive into this question, we analyze the working mechanisms of the learning-based demonstration selection methods and empirically identify two important factors related to similarity measurement: 1) The ability to integrate different levels of task-agnostic text similarities between the input of exemplars and test cases enhances generalization power across different tasks. 2) Incorporating task-specific labels when measuring the similarities significantly improves the performance on each specific task. We validate these two findings through extensive quantitative and qualitative analyses across ten datasets and various LLMs. Based on our findings, we introduce two effective yet simplified exemplar selection methods catering to task-agnostic and task-specific demands, eliminating the costly LLM inference overhead.},

In this article, we introduce you to a simple-to-use training method called Variable Sequence Length (VSL), which can reduce wall-clock times for training large language models with long sequence lengths capabilities without any changes in model architecture and training hyperparameters. Training a GPT model using VSL (2k sequence length followed by 8k sequence length) uses 29\% fewer FLOPs over training with 8k sequence length all the way through while achieving the same model performance. Variable Sequence Length Training The pre-training of most LLMs is done with a fixed sequence length, for example, 2k tokens per sequence, throughout the entire training duration. One can follow this standard training method for models with long sequences, such as 8k and above. However, this will increase training times due to the compute overhead introduced by longer sequences. Figure 2 depicts the Variable Sequence Length (VSL) method, which breaks standard LLM training into two stages. In the first stage, Stage-1, the model is trained with sequence lengths much shorter than the desired long sequence length, for example, 2k tokens per sequence. This is followed by an adaptation or fine-tuning phase, called Stage-2, where the model is trained for the desired long sequence length, for example, 8k tokens per sequence. The choice of the short sequence length and the fraction of pre-training steps for Stage-1 depends on the desired reduction in pre-training FLOPs and available compute resources. A model trained with a smaller sequence length and a significant fraction of steps in Stage-1 will result in a larger reduction in pre-training FLOPs. We do not modify other hyperparameters, such as optimizer states or learning rate schedules between the two stages.},

  abstract = {Widespread efforts are being made to mitigate environmental degradation driven by human activities. From a supply chain management perspective, companies aim at improving their environmental and organizational performance along their supply chain simultaneously. Since consumers are the sources of manufacturing companies' profitability, companies are interested in understanding the extent to which consumers care about their green practices. However, while some consumers would have a higher willingness to pay a premium (WPP) or purchase intention (PI) for environmentally differentiated products, others would not. Moreover, there is scant evidence regarding the integrated effects of intra- and inter-organizational green supply chain practices on green consumerism. Therefore, this study adopts two psychological approaches (i.e., protected values and halo effect) to describe this relationship based on two models that encompass mediation and moderation effects. Data were collected from 351 Colombian university students through a behavioral experiment with three product-based conditions, and the hypotheses were tested using two-instance repeated-measures linear regressions and non-parametric tests. The results indicate that perceived product performance mediates the effect of green supply chain practices on consumers' WPP and PI (halo effect). Additionally, consumers' moral orientation toward the environment (protected values) moderates the effects of green supply chain practices on consumers' WPP, PI and perceived product performance. The study found that people who hold protected values evaluate products better not just for its green attributes, but because of their increased perception of the products' performance. The contributions are centered on the role of psychological approaches in green supply chain studies to understand consumers' preferences.},

  abstract = {Drawing from research on the halo effect and protected values, consumers' adoption intentions and willingness to pay a premium for renewable energy were explored. Two theoretical models that involve moderated mediation were tested through two-instance repeated-measures linear regressions and non-parametric tests in a behavioral experiment with an Amazon MTurk sample. In line with the expected halo effect, the effects of the renewability of the energy sources on consumers' adoption intentions and willingness to pay a premium were mediated through consumers' perceived comfort. These mediation effects were stronger among consumers with high protected values compared to those with low protected values. The results suggest that the positive evaluations of renewable energies by consumers with high protected values are mainly driven by those values. Conversely, consumers with low protected values would have lower adoption intentions, would be less willing to pay more, and they would not feel comfort at home when using renewable energy compared to consumers with high protected values.},

Utilizing four canonical two-player games -- Prisoner's Dilemma, Stag Hunt, Snowdrift, and Prisoner's Delight -- we explore how these models navigate social dilemmas, situations where players can either cooperate for a collective benefit or defect for individual gain. Crucially, we extend our analysis to examine the role of contextual framing, such as diplomatic relations or casual friendships, in shaping the models' decisions. Our findings reveal a complex landscape: while GPT-3.5 is highly sensitive to contextual framing, it shows limited ability to engage in abstract strategic reasoning. Both GPT-4 and LLaMa-2 adjust their strategies based on game structure and context, but LLaMa-2 exhibits a more nuanced understanding of the games' underlying mechanics. These results highlight the current limitations and varied proficiencies of LLMs in strategic decision-making, cautioning against their unqualified use in tasks requiring complex strategic reasoning.},

In this study, we examine LLMs' performance on the Horizon decision making task studied by Binz and Schulz (2023) analyzing how LLMs respond to variations in prompts and hyperparameters. By experimenting on three OpenAI language models possessing different capabilities, we observe that the decision making abilities fluctuate based on the input prompts and temperature settings.

While frontier models have already been used as aids to human scientists, e.g. for brainstorming ideas, writing code, or prediction tasks, they still conduct only a small part of the scientific process. This paper presents the first comprehensive framework for fully automatic scientific discovery, enabling frontier large language models to perform research independently and communicate their findings. We introduce The AI Scientist, which generates novel research ideas, writes code, executes experiments, visualizes results, describes its findings by writing a full scientific paper, and then runs a simulated review process for evaluation. In principle, this process can be repeated to iteratively develop ideas in an open-ended fashion, acting like the human scientific community. We demonstrate its versatility by applying it to three distinct subfields of machine learning: diffusion modeling, transformer-based language modeling, and learning dynamics. Each idea is implemented and developed into a full paper at a cost of less than \$15 per paper. To evaluate the generated papers, we design and validate an automated reviewer, which we show achieves near-human performance in evaluating paper scores. The AI Scientist can produce papers that exceed the acceptance threshold at a top machine learning conference as judged by our automated reviewer. This approach signifies the beginning of a new era in scientific discovery in machine learning: bringing the transformative benefits of AI agents to the entire research process of AI itself, and taking us closer to a world where endless affordable creativity and innovation can be unleashed on the world's most challenging problems.

  abstract = {It is often unclear which factor plays a more critical role in determining a group's performance: the diversity among members of the group or their individual abilities. In this study, we addressed this ``diversity vs. ability'' issue in a decision-making task. We conducted three simulation studies in which we manipulated agents' individual ability (or accuracy, in the context of our investigation) and group diversity by varying (1) the heuristics agents used to search task-relevant information (i.e., cues); (2) the size of their groups; (3) how much they had learned about a good cue search order; and (4) the magnitude of errors in the information they searched. In each study, we found that a manipulation reducing agents' individual accuracy simultaneously increased their group's diversity, leading to a conflict between the two. These conflicts enabled us to identify certain conditions under which diversity trumps individual accuracy, and vice versa. Specifically, we found that individual accuracy is more important in task environments in which cues differ greatly in the quality of their information, and diversity matters more when such differences are relatively small. Changing the size of a group and the amount of learning by an agent had a limited impact on this general effect of task environment. Furthermore, we found that a group achieves its highest accuracy when there is an intermediate amount of errors in the cue information, regardless of the environment and the heuristic used, an effect that we believe has not been previously reported and warrants further investigation.},

These capabilities, referred to as ``emergent abilities,'' have been a driving force in discussions regarding the potentials and risks of language models. A key challenge in evaluating emergent abilities is that they are confounded by model competencies that arise through alternative prompting techniques, including in-context learning, which is the ability of models to complete a task based on a few examples. We present a novel theory that explains emergent abilities, taking into account their potential confounding factors, and rigorously substantiate this theory through over 1000 experiments. Our findings suggest that purported emergent abilities are not truly emergent, but result from a combination of in-context learning, model memory, and linguistic knowledge. Our work is a foundational step in explaining language model performance, providing a template for their efficient use and clarifying the paradox of their ability to excel in some instances while faltering in others. Thus, we demonstrate that their capabilities should not be overestimated.},

In this paper, through three pre-registered, randomized human subject experiments, we explore whether and how the provision of second opinions may affect decision-makers' behavior and performance in AI-assisted decision-making. We find that if both the AI model's decision recommendation and a second opinion are always presented together, decision-makers reduce their over-reliance on AI while increase their under-reliance on AI, regardless whether the second opinion is generated by a peer or another AI model. However, if decision-makers have the control to decide when to solicit a peer's second opinion, we find that their active solicitations of second opinions have the potential to mitigate over-reliance on AI without inducing increased under-reliance in some cases. We conclude by discussing the implications of our findings for promoting effective human-AI collaborations in decision-making.},

However, it is still unknown whether state-of-the-art LLMs master sufficient knowledge related to heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. It will be inspiring if LLMs can think and learn like professionals in the HVAC industry. Hence, this study investigates the performance of LLMs on mastering the knowledge and skills related to the HVAC industry by letting them take the ASHRAE Certified HVAC Designer examination, an authoritative examination in the HVAC industry. Three key knowledge capabilities are explored: recall, analysis and application. Twelve representative LLMs are tested such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and LLaMA. According to the results, GPT-4 passes the ASHRAE Certified HVAC Designer examination with scores from 74 to 78, which is higher than about half of human examinees. Besides, GPT-3.5 passes the examination twice out of five times. It demonstrates that some LLMs such as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 have great potential to assist or replace humans in designing and operating HVAC systems. However, they still make some mistakes sometimes due to the lack of knowledge, poor reasoning capabilities and unsatisfactory equation calculation abilities. Accordingly, four future research directions are proposed to reveal how to utilize and improve LLMs in the HVAC industry: teaching LLMs to use design tools or software in the HVAC industry, enabling LLMs to read and analyze the operational data from HVAC systems, developing tailored corpuses for the HVAC industry, and assessing the performance of LLMs in real-world HVAC design and operation scenarios.},

Inspired by the cognitive map, this paper proposes a hierarchical reinforcement learning (HRL)-based framework with sound biological plausibility named Cog-MP, which combines the cognitive map and motion primitive (MP) in human-like decision making. In the proposed Cog-MP, three general levels involved in ADS are integrated in a top--bottom way, including operational, decision-making, and cognitive levels. The proposed Cog-MP is used to make human-like decisions in lane-changing scenarios, focusing on three aspects: human-like lane decision, human-like path decision, and decision optimization. The proposed framework is validated on two groups of realistic lane-change data, of which one group is used to train cognitions towards different styles of driving behaviors, and the other group is to provide validation scenarios. Experimental results show that the proposed framework can generate human-like decisions and perform soundly regarding the three considered aspects, demonstrating a promising prospect in developing a brain-inspired human-like ADS.},

Current research frequently relies on simplified, ``one-size-fits-all'' models to characterize an average human decision-maker, thus failing to capture the heterogeneity of people's decision-making behavior when incorporating AI assistance. To address this, we propose Mix and Match (M\&M), a novel computational framework that explicitly models the diversity of human decisionmakers and their unique patterns of relying on AI assistance. M\&M represents the population of decision-makers as a mixture of distinct decision-making processes, with each process corresponding to a specific type of decision-maker. This approach enables us to infer latent behavioral patterns from limited data of human decisions under AI assistance, offering valuable insights into the cognitive processes underlying human-AI collaboration. Using real-world behavioral data, our empirical evaluation demonstrates that M\&M consistently outperforms baseline methods in predicting human decision behavior. Furthermore, through a detailed analysis of the decision-maker types identified in our framework, we provide quantitative insights into nuanced patterns of how different individuals adopt AI recommendations. These findings offer implications for designing personalized and effective AI systems based on the diverse landscape of human behavior patterns in AI-assisted decision-making across various domains.},

To evaluate this possibility, we trained (next word prediction) a relatively small 124M-parameter GPT-2 model on 1.3 billion tokens of domain-specific knowledge. Despite being orders of magnitude smaller than larger LLMs trained on trillions of tokens, small models achieved expert-level performance in predicting neuroscience results. Small models trained on the neuroscience literature succeeded when they were trained from scratch using a tokenizer specifically trained on neuroscience text or when the neuroscience literature was used to finetune a pretrained GPT-2.

The model adopts a Bayesian framework for probabilistic graph matching, operating on semantic relation networks constructed from distributed representations of individual concepts and of relations between concepts. Through comparisons of model predictions with human performance in a novel mapping task requiring integration of multiple relations, as well as in several classic studies, we demonstrate that the model accounts for a broad range of phenomena involving analogical mapping by both adults and children. We also show the potential for extending the model to deal with analog retrieval. Our approach demonstrates that human-like analogical mapping can emerge from comparison mechanisms applied to rich semantic representations of individual concepts and relations.

While researchers continue to improve the capabilities of LLMs in the pursuit of artificial general intelligence, SLM research aims to make machine intelligence more accessible, affordable, and efficient for everyday tasks. Focusing on transformer-based, decoder-only language models with 100M--5B parameters, we survey 59 state-of-the-art open-source SLMs, analyzing their technical innovations across three axes: architectures, training datasets, and training algorithms. In addition, we evaluate their capabilities in various domains, including commonsense reasoning, in-context learning, mathematics, and coding. To gain further insight into their on-device runtime costs, we benchmark their inference latency and memory footprints. Through in-depth analysis of our benchmarking data, we offer valuable insights to advance research in this field.},

While traditional pair programming between humans has been extensively studied, it remains uncertain whether its findings can be applied to human-AI pair programming. We compare human-human and human-AI pair programming, exploring their similarities and differences in interaction, measures, benefits, and challenges. We find that the effectiveness of both approaches is mixed in the literature (though the measures used for pAIr programming are not as comprehensive). We summarize moderating factors on the success of human-human pair programming, which provides opportunities for pAIr programming research. For example, mismatched expertise makes pair programming less productive, therefore well-designed AI programming assistants may adapt to differences in expertise levels.},

Whether we are seeking to simulate human reasoning, or the goal is to achieve bounded optimality, we generally aim to make artificial agents as rational as possible. Despite the centrality of the concept within AI, there is no unified definition of what constitutes a rational agent. This article provides a survey of rationality and irrationality in artificial intelligence, and sets out the open questions in this area. The understanding of rationality in other fields has influenced its conception within artificial intelligence, in particular work in economics, philosophy and psychology. Focusing on the behaviour of artificial agents, we consider irrational behaviours that can prove to be optimal in certain scenarios. Some methods have been developed to deal with irrational agents, both in terms of identification and interaction, however work in this area remains limited. Methods that have up to now been developed for other purposes, namely adversarial scenarios, may be adapted to suit interactions with artificial agents. We further discuss the interplay between human and artificial agents, and the role that rationality plays within this interaction; many questions remain in this area, relating to potentially irrational behaviour of both humans and artificial agents.},

LLMs have been shown to contain human biases due to the data they have been trained on; whether this is reflected in rational reasoning remains less clear. In this paper, we answer this question by evaluating seven language models using tasks from the cognitive psychology literature. We find that, like humans, LLMs display irrationality in these tasks. However, the way this irrationality is displayed does not reflect that shown by humans. When incorrect answers are given by LLMs to these tasks, they are often incorrect in ways that differ from human-like biases. On top of this, the LLMs reveal an additional layer of irrationality in the significant inconsistency of the responses. Aside from the experimental results, this paper seeks to make a methodological contribution by showing how we can assess and compare different capabilities of these types of models, in this case with respect to rational reasoning.},

These tools are sometimes used to aid users in performing their task, for example, when an artificial intelligence tool assists a radiologist in their search for abnormalities in radiographic images. The use of artificial intelligence brings a wealth of benefits, such as increasing the efficiency and efficacy of performance. However, little research has been conducted to determine how the use of artificial intelligence assistants might affect the user's cognitive skills. In this theoretical perspective, we discuss how artificial intelligence assistants might accelerate skill decay among experts and hinder skill acquisition among learners. Further, we discuss how AI assistants might also prevent experts and learners from recognizing these deleterious effects. We then discuss the types of questions: use-inspired basic cognitive researchers, applied researchers, and computer science researchers should seek to answer. We conclude that multidisciplinary research from use-inspired basic cognitive research, domain-specific applied research, and technical research (e.g., human factors research, computer science research) is needed to (a) understand these potential consequences, (b) design artificial intelligence systems to mitigate these impacts, and (c) develop training and use protocols to prevent negative impacts on users' cognitive skills. Only by answering these questions from multidisciplinary perspectives can we harness the benefits of artificial intelligence in the workplace while preventing negative impacts on users' cognitive skills.},

  abstract = {The field of data visualisation has long aimed to devise solutions for generating visualisations directly from natural language text. Research in Natural Language Interfaces (NLIs) has contributed towards the development of such techniques. However, the implementation of workable NLIs has always been challenging due to the inherent ambiguity of natural language, as well as in consequence of unclear and poorly written user queries which pose problems for existing language models in discerning user intent. Instead of pursuing the usual path of developing new iterations of language models, this study uniquely proposes leveraging the advancements in pre-trained large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT and GPT-3 to convert free-form natural language directly into code for appropriate visualisations. This paper presents a novel system, Chat2VIS, which takes advantage of the capabilities of LLMs and demonstrates how, with effective prompt engineering, the complex problem of language understanding can be solved more efficiently, resulting in simpler and more accurate end-to-end solutions than prior approaches. Chat2VIS shows that LLMs together with the proposed prompts offer a reliable approach to rendering visualisations from natural language queries, even when queries are highly misspecified and underspecified. This solution also presents a significant reduction in costs for the development of NLI systems, while attaining greater visualisation inference abilities compared to traditional NLP approaches that use hand-crafted grammar rules and tailored models. This study also presents how LLM prompts can be constructed in a way that preserves data security and privacy while being generalisable to different datasets. This work compares the performance of GPT-3, Codex and ChatGPT across several case studies and contrasts the performances with prior studies.},

We ground this distinction in human neuroscience, which has shown that formal and functional competence rely on different neural mechanisms. Although LLMs are surprisingly good at formal competence, their performance on functional competence tasks remains spotty and often requires specialized fine-tuning and/or coupling with external modules. We posit that models that use language in human-like ways would need to master both of these competence types, which, in turn, could require the emergence of separate mechanisms specialized for formal versus functional linguistic competence.},

In such a paradigm, humans are found to rarely trigger analytical thinking and face difficulties in communicating the nuances of conflicting opinions to the AI when disagreements occur. To tackle this challenge, we propose Human-AI Deliberation, a novel framework to promote human reflection and discussion on conflicting human-AI opinions in decision-making. Based on theories in human deliberation, this framework engages humans and AI in dimension-level opinion elicitation, deliberative discussion, and decision updates. To empower AI with deliberative capabilities, we designed Deliberative AI, which leverages large language models (LLMs) as a bridge between humans and domain-specific models to enable flexible conversational interactions and faithful information provision. An exploratory evaluation on a graduate admissions task shows that Deliberative AI outperforms conventional explainable AI (XAI) assistants in improving humans' appropriate reliance and task performance. Based on a mixed-methods analysis of participant behavior, perception, user experience, and open-ended feedback, we draw implications for future AI-assisted decision tool design.},

  abstract = {The efficient representation of visual information is essential for learning and decision making due to the complexity and uncertainty of the world, as well as inherent constraints on the capacity of cognitive systems. We hypothesize that biological agents learn to efficiently represent visual information in a manner that balances performance across multiple potentially competing objectives. In this paper we examine two such objectives: storing information in a manner that supports accurate recollection (maximizing veridicality) and storing information in a manner that facilitates utility-based decision making (maximizing behavioral utility). That these two objectives may be in conflict is not immediately obvious. Our hypothesis suggests that neither behavior nor representation formation can be fully understood by studying either in isolation, with information processing constraints exerting an over-arching influence. Alongside this hypothesis we develop a computational model of representation formation and behavior motivated by recent methods in machine learning and neuroscience. The resulting model explains both the beneficial aspects of human visual learning, such as fast acquisition and high generalization, as well as the biases that result from information constraints. To test this model, we developed two experimental paradigms, in decision making and learning, to evaluate how well the model's predictions match human behavior. A key feature of the proposed model is that it predicts the occurrence of commonly found biases in human decision making, resulting from the desire to form efficient representations of visual information that are useful for behavioral goals in learning and decision making and optimized under an information processing constraint}

This lack of cognitively-aware personalization of similarity metrics can be particularly problematic in educational and recommendation settings where there is a limited number of individual judgements of category or preference, and biases can be particularly relevant. To address this, we rely on an integration of an Instance-Based Learning (IBL) cognitive model with LLM embeddings to develop the Instance-Based Individualized Similarity (IBIS) metric. This similarity metric is beneficial in that it takes into account individual biases and constraints in a manner that is grounded in the cognitive mechanisms of decision making. To evaluate the IBIS metric, we also introduce a dataset of human categorizations of emails as being either dangerous (phishing) or safe (ham). This dataset is used to demonstrate the benefits of leveraging a cognitive model to measure the subjective similarity of human participants in an educational setting.},

Participants drove the simulator-based LCT without (baseline) and with a three-level auditory-verbal response N-back task (i.e., 0-back,1-back, and 2-back) developed to tax working memory capacity. The included driving parameters were: mean deviation in the lane change path (MDEV), percentage of correct lane changes (PCL) in response to a lane change sign, and lane change initiation (LCI). The percentage of error rate (PER) was included to measure participants' performance on the secondary task. Dual-task performance of both groups deteriorated with increasing cognitive load, but this effect was more pronounced in the autistic group. Specifically, the performance of both group on MDEV, PCL, and PER suffered from the increasing cognitive load. Nevertheless, neither PCL nor LCI differ between autistic and non-autistic participants. Notably, LCI also deteriorated with increasing cognitive load for non-autistic participants, but not for autistic participants. Similar to previous research, it is suggested that distracted driving should be eliminated as much as possible before occurring in the first place. Specific suggestions for eliminating distraction in autistic drivers are provided.},

We address one aspect of this broad question: whether LMs' words can refer, that is, achieve ``word-to-world'' connections. There is prima facie reason to think they do not, since LMs do not interact with the world in the way that ordinary language users do. Drawing on the externalist tradition in philosophy of language, we argue that those appearances are misleading: Even if the inputs to LMs are simply strings of text, they are strings of text with natural histories, and that may suffice for LMs' words to refer.},

In contrast, human advisors in group decision-making perform various roles, such as analyzing alternative options or criticizing decision-makers to encourage their critical thinking. This diversity of roles has not yet been empirically explored in AI assistance. In this paper, we examine three AI roles: Recommender, Analyzer, and Devil's Advocate, and evaluate their effects across two AI performance levels. Our results show each role's distinct strengths and limitations in task performance, reliance appropriateness, and user experience. Notably, the Recommender role is not always the most effective, especially if the AI performance level is low, the Analyzer role may be preferable.

  abstract = {Determining the extent to which the perceptual world can be recovered from language is a longstanding problem in philosophy and cognitive science. We show that state-of-the-art large language models can unlock new insights into this problem by providing a lower bound on the amount of perceptual information that can be extracted from language. Specifically, we elicit pairwise similarity judgments from GPT models across six psychophysical datasets. We show that the judgments are significantly correlated with human data across all domains, recovering well-known representations like the color wheel and pitch spiral. Surprisingly, we find that a model (GPT-4) co-trained on vision and language does not necessarily lead to improvements specific to the visual modality, and provides highly correlated predictions with human data irrespective of whether direct visual input is provided or purely textual descriptors. To study the impact of specific languages, we also apply the models to a multilingual color-naming task. We find that GPT-4 replicates cross-linguistic variation in English and Russian illuminating the interaction of language and perception.},

  abstract = {Similarity judgments provide a well-established method for accessing mental representations, with applications in psychology, neuroscience and machine learning. However, collecting similarity judgments can be prohibitively expensive for naturalistic datasets as the number of comparisons grows quadratically in the number of stimuli. One way to tackle this problem is to construct approximation procedures that rely on more accessible proxies for predicting similarity. Here we leverage recent advances in language models and online recruitment, proposing an efficient domain-general procedure for predicting human similarity judgments based on text descriptions. Intuitively, similar stimuli are likely to evoke similar descriptions, allowing us to use description similarity to predict pairwise similarity judgments. Crucially, the number of descriptions required grows only linearly with the number of stimuli, drastically reducing the amount of data required. We test this procedure on six datasets of naturalistic images and show that our models outperform previous approaches based on visual information.},

  abstract = {Humans rely on efficient distribution of resources to transcend the abilities of individuals. Successful task allocation, whether in small teams or across large institutions, depends on individuals' ability to discern their own and others' strengths and weaknesses, and to optimally act on them. This dependence creates a tension between exploring the capabilities of others and exploiting the knowledge acquired so far, which can be challenging. How do people navigate this tension? To address this question, we propose a novel task allocation paradigm in which a human agent is asked to repeatedly allocate tasks in three distinct classes (categorizing a blurry image, detecting a noisy voice command, and solving an anagram) between themselves and two other (bot) team members to maximize team performance. We show that this problem can be recast as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit which allows us to compare people's performance against two well-known strategies, Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). We find that humans are able to successfully integrate information about the capabilities of different team members to infer optimal allocations, and in some cases perform on par with these optimal strategies. Our approach opens up new avenues for studying the mechanisms underlying collective cooperation in teams.},

  abstract = {Human similarity judgments are a powerful supervision signal for machine learning applications based on techniques such as contrastive learning, information retrieval, and model alignment, but classical methods for collecting human similarity judgments are too expensive to be used at scale. Recent methods propose using pre-trained deep neural networks (DNNs) to approximate human similarity, but pre-trained DNNs may not be available for certain domains (e.g., medical images, low-resource languages) and their performance in approximating human similarity has not been extensively tested. We conducted an evaluation of 611 pre-trained models across three domains -- images, audio, video -- and found that there is a large gap in performance between human similarity judgments and pre-trained DNNs. To address this gap, we propose a new class of similarity approximation methods based on language. To collect the language data required by these new methods, we also developed and validated a novel adaptive tag collection pipeline. We find that our proposed language-based methods are significantly cheaper, in the number of human judgments, than classical methods, but still improve performance over the DNN-based methods. Finally, we also develop `stacked' methods that combine language embeddings with DNN embeddings, and find that these consistently provide the best approximations for human similarity across all three of our modalities. Based on the results of this comprehensive study, we provide a concise guide for researchers interested in collecting or approximating human similarity data. To accompany this guide, we also release all of the similarity and language data, a total of 206,339 human judgments, that we collected in our experiments, along with a detailed breakdown of all modeling results.},

Using over 16,000 texts from four samples and tested against three prompts and two large language models (GPT-3.5, GPT-4), the evidence suggests there were small associations between ChatGPT and LIWC analytic thinking scores (meta-analytic effect sizes: .058 {$<$} rs {$<$} .304; ps {$<$} .001). When given the formula to calculate the LIWC analytic thinking index, ChatGPT performed incorrect mathematical operations in 22\% of the cases, suggesting basic word and number processing may be unreliable with large language models.

However, this line of work is controversial, with some authors pointing out failures of these probes to generalize in basic ways, among other conceptual issues. In this work, we curate high-quality datasets of true/false statements and use them to study in detail the structure of LLM representations of truth, drawing on three lines of evidence: 1. Visualizations of LLM true/false statement representations, which reveal clear linear structure. 2. Transfer experiments in which probes trained on one dataset generalize to different datasets. 3. Causal evidence obtained by surgically intervening in a LLM's forward pass, causing it to treat false statements as true and vice versa. Overall, we present evidence that language models linearly represent the truth or falsehood of factual statements. We also introduce a novel technique, mass-mean probing, which generalizes better and is more causally implicated in model outputs than other probing techniques.},

Across four studies (consisting of seven sub-studies; total N\,=\,1788), we show that personalized messages crafted by ChatGPT exhibit significantly more influence than non-personalized messages. This was true across different domains of persuasion (e.g., marketing of consumer products, political appeals for climate action), psychological profiles (e.g., personality traits, political ideology, moral foundations), and when only providing the LLM with a single, short prompt naming or describing the targeted psychological dimension. Thus, our findings are among the first to demonstrate the potential for LLMs to automate, and thereby scale, the use of personalized persuasion in ways that enhance its effectiveness and efficiency. We discuss the implications for researchers, practitioners, and the general public.},

We argue that to develop a holistic understanding of these systems, we must consider the problem that they were trained to solve: next-word prediction over Internet text. By recognizing the pressures that this task exerts, we can make predictions about the strategies that LLMs will adopt, allowing us to reason about when they will succeed or fail. Using this approach---which we call the teleological approach---we identify three factors that we hypothesize will influence LLM accuracy: the probability of the task to be performed, the probability of the target output, and the probability of the provided input. To test our predictions, we evaluate five LLMs (GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Claude 3, Llama 3, and Gemini 1.0) on 11 tasks, and we find robust evidence that LLMs are influenced by probability in the hypothesized ways. Many of the experiments reveal surprising failure modes. For instance, GPT-4's accuracy at decoding a simple cipher is 51\% when the output is a high-probability sentence but only 13\% when it is low-probability, even though this task is a deterministic one for which probability should not matter. These results show that AI practitioners should be careful about using LLMs in low-probability situations. More broadly, we conclude that we should not evaluate LLMs as if they are humans but should instead treat them as a distinct type of system---one that has been shaped by its own particular set of pressures.},

We apply these analyses to four neural language models (an LSTM, a Transformer, Transformer-XL, and GPT-2). For local structure - e.g., individual dependencies - model-generated text is substantially less novel than our baseline of human-generated text from each model's test set. For larger-scale structure - e.g., overall sentence structure - model-generated text is as novel or even more novel than the human-generated baseline, but models still sometimes copy substantially, in some cases duplicating passages over 1,000 words long from the training set. We also perform extensive manual analysis showing that GPT-2's novel text is usually well-formed morphologically and syntactically but has reasonably frequent semantic issues (e.g., being self-contradictory).},

Two extreme reactions are common. Neural network enthusiasts argue that, because the inner workings of DNNs do not seem to resemble any of the traditional constructs of psychological or linguistic theory, their success renders these theories obsolete and motivates a radical paradigm shift. Neural network skeptics instead take this inability to interpret DNNs in psychological terms to mean that their success is irrelevant to psychological science. In this paper, we review recent work that suggests that the internal mechanisms of DNNs can, in fact, be interpreted in the functional terms characteristic of psychological explanations. We argue that this undermines the shared assumption of both extremes and opens the door for DNNs to inform theories of cognition and its development.},

As such, continuing to frame human-autonomy teams as technologically advanced human-human teams might not only restrict the global effectiveness of these teams but doing so might also stagnate these teams from being well perceived and respected by humans. However, recent efforts to differentiate human-autonomy teams have prioritized the differentiation from human-autonomy interactions rather than human-human teams. The following article further differentiates human-autonomy teams from human-human teams by first discussing the core differentiating considerations of human-autonomy teams. These considerations are then used to craft research trajectories that simultaneously leverage past theory in human-human teaming and the specific limitations and capabilities of human-autonomy teams to further propel and differentiate this novel teaming construct. In doing the above, this work presents a novel teaming construct that merges teamwork and human-computer interaction research to craft a standalone but theory-driven identity for human-autonomy teams, and this identity will serve future research to help better differentiate human-autonomy and human-human teaming.},

Current argument summarization approaches miss an important facet of this task -- capturing diversity -- which is important for accommodating multiple perspectives. We introduce three aspects of diversity: those of opinions, annotators, and sources. We evaluate approaches to a popular argument summarization task called Key Point Analysis, which shows how these approaches struggle to (1) represent arguments shared by few people, (2) deal with data from various sources, and (3) align with subjectivity in human-provided annotations. We find that both general-purpose LLMs and dedicated KPA models exhibit this behavior, but have complementary strengths. Further, we observe that diversification of training data may ameliorate generalization. Addressing diversity in argument summarization requires a mix of strategies to deal with subjectivity.},

Specifically, we explore ChatGPT's ability to provide code, explain basic concepts, and create knowledge related to SPC practice, learning, and research. By investigating responses to structured prompts, we highlight the benefits and limitations of the results. Our study indicates that the current version of ChatGPT performs well for structured tasks, such as translating code from one language to another and explaining well-known concepts but struggles with more nuanced tasks, such as explaining less widely known terms and creating code from scratch. We find that using new AI tools may help practitioners, educators, and researchers to be more efficient and productive. However, in their current stages of development, some results are misleading and wrong. Overall, the use of generative AI models in SPC must be properly validated and used in conjunction with other methods to ensure accurate results.},

  abstract = {Introduction Understanding the shortcomings of child-pedestrians in evaluating traffic situations may contribute to producing intervention techniques that may increase their awareness to potential hazards as well as inform and inspire designers of autonomous vehicle and infrastructure systems to deal with the complications of crossing pedestrians. Method: The present work examined pedestrians' hazard-perception (HP) skills in complex traffic scenes. Two experiments explored how pedestrians' HP abilities vary with age and experience. In the first, adults and youngsters (7--13-year-olds) were presented with pairs of photographs displaying traffic situations and instructed to compare between the hazard levels of the two. Findings revealed a marked trend where experienced-adults tended to rate photographs depicting field of view partially obscured by parked vehicles as more hazardous. Moreover, adults tended to rate photographs depicting vehicles closer to the crossing site as more hazardous. Lastly, adults tended to rate photographs depicting complex configurations like traffic circles, as more hazardous than T-junctions. Results: Findings suggested that youngsters may be highly influenced by cueing. Next, pedestrians' HP was tested using a crossing decision task. Participants observed traffic scenes presented in a dynamic simulated environment of an urban road from a pedestrian's perspective and pressed a response button whenever they assumed it was safe to cross. Compared to experienced-adults and 7--8-year-olds, 9--13-year-olds presented a less decisive performance. Compared to previous findings regarding simpler road crossing configurations, most participants, regardless of age, related more to the approaching vehicles and presence of a pedestrian crossing while refraining from addressing the road configuration. Implications for road-safety are discussed.},

ChatGPT-4 exhibits behavioral and personality traits that are statistically indistinguishable from a random human from tens of thousands of human subjects from more than 50 countries. Chatbots also modify their behavior based on previous experience and contexts ``as if'' they were learning from the interactions and change their behavior in response to different framings of the same strategic situation. Their behaviors are often distinct from average and modal human behaviors, in which case they tend to behave on the more altruistic and cooperative end of the distribution. We estimate that they act as if they are maximizing an average of their own and partner's payoffs.},

However, their unique combination of graphical elements (e.g., bars, lines) and textual components (e.g., labels, legends) poses challenges for general-purpose multimodal models. While vision-language models trained on chart data excel in comprehension, they struggle with generalization. To address these challenges, we propose ChartAssistant, a chart-based vision-language model for universal chart comprehension and reasoning. ChartAssistant leverages ChartSFT, a comprehensive dataset covering diverse chart-related tasks with basic (e.g. bars and pies) and specialized (e.g. radars, and bubbles) chart types. It undergoes a two-stage training process, starting with pre-training on chart-to-table parsing to align chart and text, followed by multitask instruction-following fine-tuning. This approach enables ChartAssistant to achieve competitive performance across various chart tasks. Experimental results demonstrate significant performance gains over the state-of-the-art UniChart and Chartllama method, especially outperforming them on real-world chart data with zero-shot setting.

Understanding the implications of such advancements on drivers and road safety is important.Method:A total of 50 participants were recruited for this study and drove the simulator in both manual and highly automated mode. As well as comparing the effect of adjustments in driving-related workload on performance, the effect of a secondary Twenty Questions Task was also investigated.Results:In the absence of the secondary task, drivers' response to critical incidents was similar in manual and highly automated driving conditions. The worst performance was observed when drivers were required to regain control of driving in the automated mode while distracted by the secondary task. Blink frequency patterns were more consistent for manual than automated driving but were generally suppressed during conditions of high workload.Conclusion:Highly automated driving did not have a deleterious effect on driver performance, when attention was not diverted to the distracting secondary task.Application:As the number of systems implemented in cars increases, an understanding of the implications of such automation on drivers' situation awareness, workload, and ability to remain engaged with the driving task is important.},

Such illusions obscure the scientific community's ability to see the formation of scientific monocultures, in which some types of methods, questions and viewpoints come to dominate alternative approaches, making science less innovative and more vulnerable to errors. The proliferation of AI tools in science risks introducing a phase of scientific enquiry in which we produce more but understand less.

Many of these approaches require annotated training datasets, which limits their applicability for languages where these may not be readily available. This paper explores the applicability of large language models for automated stance detection in a challenging scenario, involving a morphologically complex, lower-resource language, and a socio-culturally complex topic, immigration. If the approach works in this case, it can be expected to perform as well or better in less demanding scenarios. We annotate a large set of pro- and anti-immigration examples to train and compare the performance of multiple language models. We also probe the usability of GPT-3.5 (that powers ChatGPT) as an instructable zero-shot classifier for the same task. The supervised models achieve acceptable performance, but GPT-3.5 yields similar accuracy. As the latter does not require tuning with annotated data, it constitutes a potentially simpler and cheaper alternative for text classification tasks, including in lower-resource languages. We further use the best-performing supervised model to investigate diachronic trends over seven years in two corpora of Estonian mainstream and right-wing populist news sources, demonstrating the applicability of automated stance detection for news analytics and media monitoring settings even in lower-resource scenarios, and discuss correspondences between stance changes and real-world events.},

However, a closer look at the development and use of ADS systems in organizational settings reveals that they necessarily involve a series of largely unspecified human decisions. They begin with deliberations for which decisions to use ADS, continue with choices while developing and deploying the ADS, and end with decisions on how to use the ADS output in an organization's operations. The article presents an overview of these decisions and some relevant behavioral phenomena. It points out directions for further research, which is essential for correctly assessing the processes and their vulnerabilities. Understanding these behavioral aspects is important for successfully implementing ADS in organizations.},

Using collective foraging to study the key trade-off between personal and social information use, we present a mechanistic, spatially-explicit agent-based model that combines individual-level evidence accumulation of personal and (visual) social cues with particle-based movement. Under idealized conditions without physical constraints, our mechanistic framework reproduces findings from established probabilistic models, but explains how individual-level decision processes generate collective outcomes in a bottom-up way. In clustered environments, groups performed best if agents reacted strongly to social information, while in uniform environments, individualistic search was most beneficial. Incorporating different real-world physical and perceptual constraints profoundly shaped collective performance, and could even buffer maladaptive herding by facilitating self-organized exploration. Our study uncovers the mechanisms linking individual cognition to collective outcomes in human and animal foraging and paves the way for decentralized robotic applications.},

One important prerequisite for studying human event perception is the ability of researchers to quantify when one event ends and another begins. Typically, this information is derived by aggregating behavioral annotations from several observers. Here we present an alternative computational approach where event boundaries are derived using a large language model, GPT-3, instead of using human annotations. We demonstrate that GPT-3 can segment continuous narrative text into events. GPT-3-annotated events are significantly correlated with human event annotations. Furthermore, these GPT-derived annotations achieve a good approximation of the ``consensus'' solution (obtained by averaging across human annotations); the boundaries identified by GPT-3 are closer to the consensus, on average, than boundaries identified by individual human annotators. This finding suggests that GPT-3 provides a feasible solution for automated event annotations, and it demonstrates a further parallel between human cognition and prediction in large language models. In the future, GPT-3 may thereby help to elucidate the principles underlying human event perception.},

Specifically, we investigate whether these models can simulate child-like language and cognitive development while solving false-belief tasks, namely, change-of-location and unexpected-content tasks. GPT-3.5-turbo and GPT-4 models by OpenAI were prompted to simulate children (N = 1296) aged one to six years. This simulation was instantiated through three types of prompts: plain zero-shot, chain-of-thoughts, and primed-by-corpus. We evaluated the correctness of responses to assess the models' capacity to mimic the cognitive skills of the simulated children. Both models displayed a pattern of increasing correctness in their responses and rising language complexity. That is in correspondence with a gradual enhancement in linguistic and cognitive abilities during child development, which is described in the vast body of research literature on child development. GPT-4 generally exhibited a closer alignment with the developmental curve observed in `real' children. However, it displayed hyper-accuracy under certain conditions, notably in the primed-by-corpus prompt type. Task type, prompt type, and the choice of language model influenced developmental patterns, while temperature and the gender of the simulated parent and child did not consistently impact results. We conducted analyses of linguistic complexity, examining utterance length and Kolmogorov complexity. These analyses revealed a gradual increase in linguistic complexity corresponding to the age of the simulated children, regardless of other variables. These findings show that the language models are capable of downplaying their abilities to achieve a faithful simulation of prompted personas.},

Much of this research is focused on explicitly explaining decisions or actions to a human observer, and it should not be controversial to say that looking at how humans explain to each other can serve as a useful starting point for explanation in artificial intelligence. However, it is fair to say that most work in explainable artificial intelligence uses only the researchers' intuition of what constitutes a `good' explanation. There exist vast and valuable bodies of research in philosophy, psychology, and cognitive science of how people define, generate, select, evaluate, and present explanations, which argues that people employ certain cognitive biases and social expectations to the explanation process. This paper argues that the field of explainable artificial intelligence can build on this existing research, and reviews relevant papers from philosophy, cognitive psychology/science, and social psychology, which study these topics. It draws out some important findings, and discusses ways that these can be infused with work on explainable artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {Large language models like GPT-4 have achieved remarkable proficiency in a broad spectrum of language-based tasks, some of which are traditionally associated with hallmarks of human intelligence. This has prompted ongoing disagreements about the extent to which we can meaningfully ascribe any kind of linguistic or cognitive competence to language models. Such questions have deep philosophical roots, echoing longstanding debates about the status of artificial neural networks as cognitive models. This article -- the first part of two companion papers -- serves both as a primer on language models for philosophers, and as an opinionated survey of their significance in relation to classic debates in the philosophy cognitive science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics. We cover topics such as compositionality, language acquisition, semantic competence, grounding, world models, and the transmission of cultural knowledge. We argue that the success of language models challenges several long-held assumptions about artificial neural networks. However, we also highlight the need for further empirical investigation to better understand their internal mechanisms. This sets the stage for the companion paper (Part II), which turns to novel empirical methods for probing the inner workings of language models, and new philosophical questions prompted by their latest developments.},

To understand the contexts in which users disclose to chatbots, we develop a taxonomy of tasks and sensitive topics, based on qualitative and quantitative analysis of naturally occurring conversations. We discuss these potential privacy harms and observe that: (1) personally identifiable information (PII) appears in unexpected contexts such as in translation or code editing (48\% and 16\% of the time, respectively) and (2) PII detection alone is insufficient to capture the sensitive topics that are common in human-chatbot interactions, such as detailed sexual preferences or specific drug use habits.

However, the validity of utilizing LLMs as stand-ins for human subjects remains uncertain due to glaring divergences that suggest fundamentally different underlying processes at play and the sensitivity of LLM responses to prompt variations. This paper presents a novel approach based on Shapley values from cooperative game theory to interpret LLM behavior and quantify the relative contribution of each prompt component to the model's output. Through two applications---a discrete choice experiment and an investigation of cognitive biases---we demonstrate how the Shapley value method can uncover what we term ``token noise'' effects, a phenomenon where LLM decisions are disproportionately influenced by tokens providing minimal informative content. This phenomenon raises concerns about the robustness and generalizability of insights obtained from LLMs in the context of human behavior simulation. Our model-agnostic approach extends its utility to proprietary LLMs, providing a valuable tool for marketers and researchers to strategically optimize prompts and mitigate apparent cognitive biases. Our findings underscore the need for a more nuanced understanding of the factors driving LLM responses before relying on them as substitutes for human subjects in research settings. We emphasize the importance of researchers reporting results conditioned on specific prompt templates and exercising caution when drawing parallels between human behavior and LLMs.},

However, despite these successes, the depth of LLMs' reasoning abilities remains uncertain. This uncertainty partly stems from the predominant focus on task performance, measured through shallow accuracy metrics, rather than a thorough investigation of the models' reasoning behavior. This paper seeks to address this gap by providing a comprehensive review of studies that go beyond task accuracy, offering deeper insights into the models' reasoning processes. Furthermore, we survey prevalent methodologies to evaluate the reasoning behavior of LLMs, emphasizing current trends and efforts towards more nuanced reasoning analyses. Our review suggests that LLMs tend to rely on surface-level patterns and correlations in their training data, rather than on genuine reasoning abilities. Additionally, we identify the need for further research that delineates the key differences between human and LLM-based reasoning.

  abstract = {While traditional optimization and scheduling schemes are designed to meet fixed, predefined system requirements, future systems are moving toward user-driven approaches and personalized services, aiming to achieve high quality-of-experience (QoE) and flexibility. This challenge is particularly pronounced in wireless and digitalized energy networks, where users' requirements have largely not been taken into consideration due to the lack of a common language between users and machines. The emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) marks a radical departure from traditional system-centric methods into more advanced user-centric approaches by providing a natural communication interface between users and devices. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce a novel architecture for resource scheduling problems by constructing three LLM agents to convert an arbitrary user's voice request (VRQ) into a resource allocation vector. Specifically, we design an LLM intent recognition agent to translate the request into an optimization problem (OP), an LLM OP parameter identification agent, and an LLM OP solving agent. To evaluate system performance, we construct a database of typical VRQs in the context of electric vehicle (EV) charging. As a proof of concept, we primarily use Llama 3 8B. Through testing with different prompt engineering scenarios, the obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed architecture. The conducted performance analysis allows key insights to be extracted. For instance, having a larger set of candidate OPs to model the real-world problem might degrade the final performance because of a higher recognition/OP classification noise level.

There has been substantial research on conceptual abstraction in AI, particularly using idealized domains such as Raven's Progressive Matrices and Bongard problems, but even when AI systems succeed on such problems, the systems are rarely evaluated in depth to see if they have actually grasped the concepts they are meant to capture. In this paper we describe an in-depth evaluation benchmark for the Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC), a collection of few-shot abstraction and analogy problems developed by Chollet [2019]. In particular, we describe ConceptARC, a new, publicly available benchmark in the ARC domain that systematically assesses abstraction and generalization abilities on a number of basic spatial and semantic concepts. ConceptARC differs from the original ARC dataset in that it is specifically organized around "concept groups" -- sets of problems that focus on specific concepts and that are vary in complexity and level of abstraction. We report results on testing humans on this benchmark as well as three machine solvers: the top two programs from a 2021 ARC competition and OpenAI's GPT-4. Our results show that humans substantially outperform the machine solvers on this benchmark, showing abilities to abstract and generalize concepts that are not yet captured by AI systems. We believe that this benchmark will spur improvements in the development of AI systems for conceptual abstraction and in the effective evaluation of such systems.},

Although ChatGPT assures that it is impartial, the literature suggests that LLMs exhibit bias involving race, gender, religion, and political orientation. Political bias in LLMs can have adverse political and electoral consequences similar to bias from traditional and social media. Moreover, political bias can be harder to detect and eradicate than gender or racial bias. We propose a novel empirical design to infer whether ChatGPT has political biases by requesting it to impersonate someone from a given side of the political spectrum and comparing these answers with its default. We also propose dose-response, placebo, and profession-politics alignment robustness tests. To reduce concerns about the randomness of the generated text, we collect answers to the same questions 100 times, with question order randomized on each round. We find robust evidence that ChatGPT presents a significant and systematic political bias toward the Democrats in the US, Lula in Brazil, and the Labour Party in the UK. These results translate into real concerns that ChatGPT, and LLMs in general, can extend or even amplify the existing challenges involving political processes posed by the Internet and social media.

  abstract = {It is uncontroversial that land animals have more elaborated cognitive abilities than their aquatic counterparts such as fish. Yet there is no apparent a-priori reason for this. A key cognitive faculty is planning. We show that in visually guided predator-prey interactions, planning provides a significant advantage, but only on land. During animal evolution, the water-to-land transition resulted in a massive increase in visual range. Simulations of behavior identify a specific type of terrestrial habitat, clustered open and closed areas (savanna-like), where the advantage of planning peaks. Our computational experiments demonstrate how this patchy terrestrial structure, in combination with enhanced visual range, can reveal and hide agents as a function of their movement and create a selective benefit for imagining, evaluating, and selecting among possible future scenarios---in short, for planning. The vertebrate invasion of land may have been an important step in their cognitive evolution.},

This lack of scholarly attention is surprising, given that voters respond to nostalgic rhetoric and may even adjust issue positions when policy is framed in nostalgic terms. This article presents a novel dataset, PolNos, which contains six text-based measures of nostalgic rhetoric in 1,648 party manifestos across 24 European democracies from 1946 to 2018. The measures combine dictionaries, word embeddings, sentiment approaches, and supervised machine learning. Our analysis yields a consistent result: nostalgia is most prevalent in manifestos of culturally conservative parties, notably Christian democratic, nationalist, and radical right parties. However, substantial variation remains regarding regional differences and whether nostalgia concerns the economy or culture. We discuss the implications and use of our dataset for studying political parties, party competition, and elections.},

Recent studies have compared the analogical reasoning abilities of human subjects and Large Language Models (LLMs) on abstract symbol manipulation tasks, such as letter string analogies. However, these studies largely neglect analogical reasoning over semantically meaningful symbols, such as natural language words. This ability to draw analogies that link language to non-linguistic domains, which we term semantic structure-mapping, is thought to play a crucial role in language acquisition and broader cognitive development. We test human subjects and LLMs on analogical reasoning tasks that require the transfer of semantic structure and content from one domain to another. Advanced LLMs match human performance across many task variations. However, humans and LLMs respond differently to certain task variations and semantic distractors. Overall, our data suggest that LLMs are approaching human-level performance on these important cognitive tasks, but are not yet entirely human like.},

A lane-change maneuver was required when the automated vehicle approaches traffic congestion on the left-hand lane. ADS-1 can only reduce the speed to synchronize with the congestion. ADS-2 reduces the speed and issues an optional request to intervene, advising the driver to change lanes manually. ADS-3 offers to overtake the congestion autonomously if the driver approves it. ADS-4 overtakes the congestion autonomously without the driver's approval. Results of drivers' reaction, acceptance, and trust indicated that differences between ADS designs increase when considering the combined effect of drivers' demographic factors more than the individual effect of each factor. However, the more ADS seems to have driver-like capacities, the more impact of demographic factors is expected. While preliminary, these findings may help us understand how ADS users' behavior can differ based on the interaction between human demographic factors and system design.},

This research aims to understand the human perception of LLM hallucinations by systematically varying the degree of hallucination (genuine, minor hallucination, major hallucination) and examining its interaction with warning (i.e., a warning of potential inaccuracies: absent vs. present). Participants (N = 419) from Prolific rated the perceived accuracy and engaged with content (e.g., like, dislike, share) in a Q/A format. Results indicate that humans rank content as truthful in the order genuine {$>$}minor hallucination {$>$}major hallucination and user engagement behaviors mirror this pattern. More importantly, we observed that warning improves hallucination detection without significantly affecting the perceived truthfulness of genuine content. We conclude by offering insights for future tools to aid human detection of hallucinations.},

One strategy to handle such overload is developing generalizable knowledge that extends to multiple related environments (``across-task'' learning). However, it is unknown whether and how social information may facilitate such across-task learning. Here, we investigated participants' social learning processes across multiple laboratory foraging sessions in spatially correlated reward landscapes that were generated according to a common rule. The results showed that paired participants were able to improve efficiency in information search across sessions more than solo participants. Computational analysis of participants' choice-behaviors revealed that such improvement across sessions was related to better understanding of the common generative rule. Rule understanding was correlated within a pair, suggesting that social interaction is a key to the improvement of across-task learning.},

We benchmark and evaluate two well-known fine-tuning approaches and evaluate the resulting populations on their ability to match the preferences of real human respondents on a survey of preferences for battery electric vehicles (BEVs). We evaluate our models against their ability to match population-wide statistics as well as their ability to match individual responses, and we investigate the role of temperature in controlling the trade-offs between these two.

  abstract = {Neural networks have long been used to model human intelligence, capturing elements of behavior and cognition, and their neural basis. Recent advancements in deep learning have enabled neural network models to reach and even surpass human levels of intelligence in many respects, yet unlike humans, their ability to learn new tasks quickly remains a challenge. People can reason not only in familiar domains, but can also rapidly learn to reason through novel problems and situations, raising the question of how well modern neural network models capture human intelligence and in which ways they diverge. In this work, we explore this gap by investigating human adults' ability to learn an abstract reasoning task based on Sudoku from a brief instructional tutorial with explanatory feedback for incorrect responses using a narrow range of training examples. We find that participants who master the task do so within a small number of trials and generalize well to puzzles outside of the training range. We also find that most of those who master the task can describe a valid solution strategy, and such participants perform better on transfer puzzles than those whose strategy descriptions are vague or incomplete. Interestingly, fewer than half of our human participants were successful in acquiring a valid solution strategy, and this ability is associated with high school mathematics education. We consider the challenges these findings pose for building computational models that capture all aspects of our findings and point toward a possible role for learning to engage in explanation-based reasoning to support rapid learning and generalization.},

We found that recommendations provided by a dissimilar AI had a higher overall effect on human decisions than recommendations from a similar AI. However, when humans and AI disagreed, participants were more likely to change their decisions when provided with recommendations from a similar AI. The effect was not due to humans' perceptions of the AI being similar, but rather due to the AI displaying similar ethical values through its recommendations.

In this paper, we introduce a system, VITALITY, intended to complement existing practices. In particular, VITALITY promotes serendipitous discovery of relevant literature using transformer language models, allowing users to find semantically similar papers in a word embedding space given (1) a list of input paper(s) or (2) a working abstract. VITALITY visualizes this document-level embedding space in an interactive 2-D scatterplot using dimension reduction. VITALITY also summarizes meta information about the document corpus or search query, including keywords and co-authors, and allows users to save and export papers for use in a literature review. We present qualitative findings from an evaluation of VITALITY, suggesting it can be a promising complementary technique for conducting academic literature reviews. Furthermore, we contribute data from 38 popular data visualization publication venues in VITALITY, and we provide scrapers for the open-source community to continue to grow the list of supported venues.},

We use sentence embeddings to identify response categories and compute semantic similarities, which we use to generate jump profiles. Our results corroborate earlier work in humans reporting both persistent (deep search in few semantic spaces) and flexible (broad search across multiple semantic spaces) pathways to creativity, where both pathways lead to similar creativity scores. LLMs were found to be biased towards either persistent or flexible paths, that varied across tasks. Though LLMs as a population match human profiles, their relationship with creativity is different, where the more flexible models score higher on creativity.

Using a meta-analysis of 116 studies, we examine the effects of information-based interventions on residential customers' consumption of electricity, gas, and water. We find evidence of publication bias in this literature. After correcting for publication bias, meta-analysis results indicate that information-based interventions reduce consumption by an average of 6.24\%, 95\% CI [-10.72, -1.76]. In addition, we find that studies employing RCTs find smaller conservation effects, (-5.2\%, 95\% CI [-9.53, -0.51]). Our results show that the effectiveness of information-based interventions at the household level are significantly larger than those at the aggregate level (such as dorms and buildings). Finally, interventions with a shorter duration or with more frequent reporting show larger estimated effect sizes.},

  abstract = {The pervasive spread of misinformation and disinformation poses a significant threat to society. Professional fact-checkers play a key role in addressing this threat, but the vast scale of the problem forces them to prioritize their limited resources. This prioritization may consider a range of factors, such as varying risks of harm posed to specific groups of people. In this work, we investigate potential implications of using a large language model (LLM) to facilitate such prioritization. Because fact-checking impacts a wide range of diverse segments of society, it is important that diverse views are represented in the claim prioritization process. This paper examines whether a LLM can reflect the views of various groups when assessing the harms of misinformation, focusing on gender as a primary variable. We pose two central questions: (1) To what extent do prompts with explicit gender references reflect gender differences in opinion in the United States on topics of social relevance? and (2) To what extent do gender-neutral prompts align with gendered viewpoints on those topics? To analyze these questions, we present the TopicMisinfo dataset, containing 160 fact-checked claims from diverse topics, supplemented by nearly 1600 human annotations with subjective perceptions and annotator demographics. Analyzing responses to gender-specific and neutral prompts, we find that GPT 3.5-Turbo reflects empirically observed gender differences in opinion but amplifies the extent of these differences. These findings illuminate AI's complex role in moderating online communication, with implications for fact-checkers, algorithm designers, and the use of crowd-workers as annotators.

Simple information on the monetary value of energy savings was the most important element guiding cost-efficient energy efficiency investments, with information on physical energy use and carbon dioxide emissions having additional but lesser importance. The degree to which the current US EnergyGuide label guided cost-efficient decisions depends on the discount rate. Using elicited individual discount rates, the current EnergyGuide label came very close to guiding cost-efficient decisions. Using a uniform 5\% discount rate, the current label led to one-third undervaluation of energy efficiency. Our results reinforce the centrality of discounting in understanding individual behavior and guiding policy.},

We perform a suite of experiments on multiple datasets and temperature settings to demonstrate that these measures strongly correlate with the probability of failure. Additionally, we present empirical results demonstrating how these measures can be applied to few-shot prompting, chain-of-thought reasoning, and error detection.},

Understanding and predicting human behavior and biases are crucial for artificial intelligence (AI)assisted systems to provide useful assistance, yet it remains an open question whether these models can achieve this. This paper addresses this gap by leveraging the reasoning and generative capabilities of the LLMs to predict human behavior in two sequential decision-making tasks. These tasks involve balancing between exploitative and exploratory actions and handling delayed feedback---both essential for simulating real-life decision processes. We compare the performance of LLMs with a cognitive instance-based learning (IBL) model, which imitates human experiential decisionmaking. Our findings indicate that LLMs excel at rapidly incorporating feedback to enhance prediction accuracy. In contrast, the cognitive IBL model better accounts for human exploratory behaviors and effectively captures loss aversion bias --- the tendency to choose a sub-optimal goal with fewer stepcost penalties rather than exploring to find the optimal choice, even with limited experience. The results highlight the benefits of integrating LLMs with cognitive architectures, suggesting that this synergy could enhance the modeling and understanding of complex human decision-making patterns.},

A comprehensive answer lies in the dense, information-rich landscape of corporate sustainability reports. However, the sheer volume and complexity of these reports make human analysis very costly. Therefore, only a few entities worldwide have the resources to analyze these reports at scale, which leads to a lack of transparency in sustainability reporting.

Whereas previous work has focused on either personalization of teaching or optimization of teaching intervention sequences, the proposed individualized model-based planning approach represents convergence of these two lines of research. Model-based planning picks the best interventions via interactive learning of a user memory model's parameters. The approach is novel in its use of a cognitive model that can account for several key individual- and material-specific characteristics related to recall/forgetting, along with a planning technique that considers users' practice schedules. Taking a rule-based approach as a baseline, the authors evaluated the method's benefits in a controlled study of artificial teaching in second-language vocabulary learning (N=53).},

The result showed that participants' risk-taking decisions shifted toward the agents' group opinions, regardless of whether the agents' opinions tended to be risky or cautious. Additionally, when the agents' group opinions were more risk-biased and included a minority opinion, a significant association existed between the degree of the participants' shift to a riskier decision and their positive attitudes toward the agents. The agents' group opinions guided participants toward both risky and cautious decisions, and participants' attitudes toward the agents were associated with their decision-making, albeit to a limited extent.},

Language is hypothesized to play a key role in human culture, driving individual cognitive capacities and shaping communication. Yet the majority of models of collective innovation assign no cognitive capacities or language abilities to agents. Here, we contribute a computational study of collective innovation where agents are Large Language Models (LLMs) that play Little Alchemy 2, a creative video game originally developed for humans that, as we argue, captures useful aspects of innovation landscapes not present in previous test-beds. We, first, study an LLM in isolation and discover that it exhibits both useful skills and crucial limitations. We, then, study groups of LLMs that share information related to their behaviour and focus on the effect of social connectivity on collective performance. In agreement with previous human and computational studies, we observe that groups with dynamic connectivity out-compete fully-connected groups. Our work reveals opportunities and challenges for future studies of collective innovation that are becoming increasingly relevant as Generative Artificial Intelligence algorithms and humans innovate alongside each other.},

In this work we investigate the potential synergies betweens LLMs and ALife, drawing on a large body of research in the two fields. We explore the potential of LLMs as tools for ALife research, for example, as operators for evolutionary computation or the generation of open-ended environments. Reciprocally, principles of ALife, such as self-organization, collective intelligence and evolvability can provide an opportunity for shaping the development and functionalities of LLMs, leading to more adaptive and responsive models. By investigating this dynamic interplay, the paper aims to inspire innovative crossover approaches for both ALife and LLM research. Along the way, we examine the extent to which LLMs appear to increasingly exhibit properties such as emergence or collective intelligence, expanding beyond their original goal of generating text, and potentially redefining our perception of lifelike intelligence in artificial systems.},

We propose a novel design of AI systems in which the algorithm interacts with the human user in a two-sided manner and aims to provide advice only when it is likely to be beneficial for the user in making their decision. The results of a large-scale experiment show that our advising approach manages to provide advice at times of need and to significantly improve human decision making compared to fixed, non-interactive, advising approaches. This approach has additional advantages in facilitating human learning, preserving complementary strengths of human decision makers, and leading to more positive responsiveness to the advice.},

The current work presents a series of analyses showing that word frequency is a key explanatory factor underlying these two trends. First, residual errors from four language model families on four corpora show that the inverse correlation between model size and fit to reading times is the strongest on the subset of least frequent words, which is driven by excessively accurate predictions of larger model variants. Additionally, training dynamics reveal that during later training steps, all model variants learn to predict rare words and that larger model variants do so more accurately, which explains the detrimental effect of both training data amount and model size on fit to reading times. Finally, a feature attribution analysis demonstrates that larger model variants are able to accurately predict rare words based on both an effectively longer context window size as well as stronger local associations compared to smaller model variants. Taken together, these results indicate that Transformer-based language models' surprisal estimates diverge from human-like expectations due to the superhumanly complex associations they learn for predicting rare words.},

Homeowners, now acting as prosumers, have access to detailed information at 15-min or even 5-min intervals, including weather forecasts, outputs from renewable energy source (RES)-based systems, appliance schedules and the current energy balance, which details any deficits or surpluses along with their quantities and the predicted prices on the local energy market (LEM). The goal for these prosumers is to reduce costs while ensuring their home's comfort levels are maintained. However, given the complexity and the rapid decision-making required in managing this information, the need for a supportive system is evident. This is particularly true given the routine nature of these decisions, highlighting the potential for a system that provides personalized recommendations to optimize energy consumption, whether that involves adjusting the load or engaging in transactions with the LEM. In this context, we propose a recommendation system powered by large language models (LLMs), Scikit-llm and zero-shot classifiers, designed to evaluate specific scenarios and offer tailored advice for prosumers based on the available data at any given moment. Two scenarios for a prosumer of 5.9 kW are assessed using candidate labels, such as Decrease, Increase, Sell and Buy.

  abstract = {Automated scoring for divergent thinking (DT) seeks to overcome a key obstacle to creativity measurement: the effort, cost, and reliability of scoring open-ended tests. For a common test of DT, the Alternate Uses Task (AUT), the primary automated approach casts the problem as a semantic distance between a prompt and the resulting idea in a text model. This work presents an alternative approach that greatly surpasses the performance of the best existing semantic distance approaches. Our system, Ocsai, fine-tunes deep neural network-based large-language models (LLMs) on human-judged responses. Trained and evaluated against one of the largest collections of human-judged AUT responses, with 27 thousand responses collected from nine past studies, our fine-tuned large-language-models achieved up to r~=~0.81 correlation with human raters, greatly surpassing current systems (r~=~0.12--0.26). Further, learning transfers well to new test items and the approach is still robust with small numbers of training labels. We also compare prompt-based zero-shot and few-shot approaches, using GPT-3, ChatGPT, and GPT-4. This work also suggests a limit to the underlying assumptions of the semantic distance model, showing that a purely semantic approach that uses the stronger language representation of LLMs, while still improving on existing systems, does not achieve comparable improvements to our fine-tuned system. The increase in performance can support stronger applications and interventions in DT and opens the space of automated DT scoring to new areas for improving and understanding this branch of methods.},

Can such models be learned from a child's visual experience without strong inductive biases? To investigate this, we train state-of-the-art neural networks on a realistic proxy of a child's visual experience without any explicit supervision or domain-specific inductive biases. Specifically, we train both embedding models and generative models on 200 hours of headcam video from a single child collected over two years and comprehensively evaluate their performance in downstream tasks using various reference models as yardsticks. On average, the best embedding models perform at a respectable 70\% of a high-performance ImageNet-trained model, despite substantial differences in training data. They also learn broad semantic categories and object localization capabilities without explicit supervision, but they are less object-centric than models trained on all of ImageNet. Generative models trained with the same data successfully extrapolate simple properties of partially masked objects, like their rough outline, texture, colour or orientation, but struggle with finer object details. We replicate our experiments with two other children and find remarkably consistent results. Broadly useful high-level visual representations are thus robustly learnable from a sample of a child's visual experience without strong inductive biases.},

We collect 600 short stories from human participants and GPT-3, subsequently randomized and assessed on their creative quality. Results indicate that the presence of perceptual details, in conjunction with semantic diversity, is highly predictive of creativity. These results were replicated in an independent sample of stories (n = 120) generated by GPT-4. We do not observe a significant difference between human and AI-generated stories in terms of creativity ratings, and we also observe positive correlations between human and AI assessments of creativity.

To adapt the information provided by the pre-trained language models, more approaches based on feature extraction or fine-tuning were tried. However, according to our experiments, integrating these two options in a stack-and-finetune approach seems to be more appropriate for our task. Regarding the comparison of language models in terms of model distillation, we notice that distillation does not affect the effectiveness while significantly reducing the training time. We conclude that the model complexity should be adjusted to the specifics of the analyzed problem and the distillation is an efficient option for low complexity corpora without considerably affecting the overall performance.},

As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into social and professional environments, understanding their behavior within the context of social interactions and networks becomes essential. Our study analyzes LLMs' network formation behavior to examine whether the dynamics of multiple LLMs are similar to or different from human social dynamics. We observe that LLMs exhibit key social network principles, including preferential attachment, triadic closure, homophily, community structure, and the small-world phenomenon, when asked about their preferences in network formation. We also investigate LLMs' decision-making based on real-world networks, revealing that triadic closure and homophily have a stronger influence than preferential attachment and that LLMs perform well in network formation predictions. Overall, our study opens up new possibilities for using LLMs in network science research and helps develop socially aware LLMs by shedding light on their social interaction behaviors and exploring their impacts on social dynamics.},

To do this, we ran replications of 14 studies from the Many Labs 2 replication project with OpenAI's text-davinci-003 model, colloquially known as GPT-3.5. Based on our pre-registered analyses, we find that among the eight studies we could analyse, our GPT sample replicated 37.5\% of the original results and 37.5\% of the Many Labs 2 results. However, we were unable to analyse the remaining six studies due to an unexpected phenomenon we call the ``correct answer'' effect. Different runs of GPT-3.5 answered nuanced questions probing political orientation, economic preference, judgement, and moral philosophy with zero or near-zero variation in responses: with the supposedly ``correct answer.'' In one exploratory follow-up study, we found that a ``correct answer'' was robust to changing the demographic details that precede the prompt. In another, we found that most but not all ``correct answers'' were robust to changing the order of answer choices. One of our most striking findings occurred in our replication of the Moral Foundations Theory survey results, where we found GPT-3.5 identifying as a political conservative in 99.6\% of the cases, and as a liberal in 99.3\% of the cases in the reverse-order condition. However, both self-reported `GPT conservatives' and `GPT liberals' showed right-leaning moral foundations. Our results cast doubts on the validity of using LLMs as a general replacement for human participants in the social sciences. Our results also raise concerns that a hypothetical AI-led future may be subject to a diminished diversity of thought.},

In this paper, we introduce generative agents--computational software agents that simulate believable human behavior. Generative agents wake up, cook breakfast, and head to work; artists paint, while authors write; they form opinions, notice each other, and initiate conversations; they remember and reflect on days past as they plan the next day. To enable generative agents, we describe an architecture that extends a large language model to store a complete record of the agent's experiences using natural language, synthesize those memories over time into higher-level reflections, and retrieve them dynamically to plan behavior. We instantiate generative agents to populate an interactive sandbox environment inspired by The Sims, where end users can interact with a small town of twenty five agents using natural language. In an evaluation, these generative agents produce believable individual and emergent social behaviors: for example, starting with only a single user-specified notion that one agent wants to throw a Valentine's Day party, the agents autonomously spread invitations to the party over the next two days, make new acquaintances, ask each other out on dates to the party, and coordinate to show up for the party together at the right time. We demonstrate through ablation that the components of our agent architecture--observation, planning, and reflection--each contribute critically to the believability of agent behavior. By fusing large language models with computational, interactive agents, this work introduces architectural and interaction patterns for enabling believable simulations of human behavior.},

LOGICOM involves two agents: a persuader and a debater engaging in a multi-round debate on a controversial topic, where the persuader tries to convince the debater of the correctness of its claim. First, LOGICOM assesses the potential of LLMs to change their opinions through reasoning. Then, it evaluates the debater's performance in logical reasoning by contrasting the scenario where the persuader employs logical fallacies against one where logical reasoning is used. We use this benchmark to evaluate the performance of GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 using a dataset containing controversial topics, claims, and reasons supporting them. Our findings indicate that both GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 can adjust their opinion through reasoning. However, when presented with logical fallacies, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 are erroneously convinced 41\% and 69\% more often, respectively, compared to when logical reasoning is used.

Their size and complexity complicate traditional assessment methods, causing the emergence of alternative approaches inspired by the field of psychology. Recent studies administering psychometric questionnaires to LLMs report human-like traits in LLMs, potentially influencing LLM behaviour. However, this approach suffers from a validity problem: it presupposes that these traits exist in LLMs and that they are measurable with tools designed for humans. Typical procedures rarely acknowledge the validity problem in LLMs, comparing and interpreting average LLM scores. This study investigates this problem by comparing latent structures of personality between humans and three LLMs using two validated personality questionnaires. Findings suggest that questionnaires designed for humans do not validly measure similar constructs in LLMs, and that these constructs may not exist in LLMs at all, highlighting the need for psychometric analyses of LLM responses to avoid chasing cognitive phantoms.

The model has a number of features that take it beyond the current state of the art in modelling natural tasks, and driving in particular. First, unlike most control theoretical models in vision science and engineering---where control is directly based on observable (optical) variables---actions are based on a temporally enduring internal representation. Second, unlike the more sophisticated engineering driver models based on internal representations, our model explicitly aims to be psychologically plausible, in particular in modelling perceptual processes and their limitations. Third, unlike most psychological models, it is implemented as an actual simulation model capable of full task performance (visual sampling and longitudinal control). The model is developed and validated using a dataset from a simplified car-following experiment (               N               = 40, in both three-dimensional virtual reality and a real instrumented vehicle). The results replicate our previously reported connection between time headway and visual attention. The model reproduces this connection and predicts that it emerges from control of action uncertainty. Implications for traffic psychological models and future developments for psychologically plausible yet computationally rigorous models of full natural task performance are discussed.},

We start from the assumption that LLMs, inadvertently yet inevitably, acquire psychological traits (metaphorically speaking) from the vast text corpora on which they are trained. Such corpora contain sediments of the personalities, values, beliefs, and biases of the countless human authors of these texts, which LLMs learn through a complex training process. The traits that LLMs acquire in such a way can potentially influence their behavior, that is, their outputs in downstream tasks and applications in which they are employed, which in turn may have real-world consequences for individuals and social groups. By eliciting LLMs' responses to language-based psychometric inventories, we can bring their traits to light. Psychometric profiling enables researchers to study and compare LLMs in terms of noncognitive characteristics, thereby providing a window into the personalities, values, beliefs, and biases these models exhibit (or mimic). We discuss the history of similar ideas and outline possible psychometric approaches for LLMs. We demonstrate one promising approach, zero-shot classification, for several LLMs and psychometric inventories.

We identify real-world concepts similar to hard-to-understand theories to enhance the learning experience and comprehension of a machine learning student. The second goal is to enhance the work in the current literature that uses similarity for transcoding. We uniquely try transcoding from Python to R and vice versa, something that was not attempted before, by identifying similarities in a latent embedding space. Methods: We list several real-world analogies to show similarities with and simplify the machine learning narrative. Next, we use Cross-Lingual Model Pretraining, Denoising Auto-encoding, and Back-translation to automatically identify similarities between the programming languages, Python and R and convert code in one to another. Results: In the course of teaching machine learning to undergraduate, graduate, and general pool of students, the first author found that relating the concepts to real-world examples listed in this paper greatly enhanced student comprehension and made the topics much more approachable despite the math and the methods involved. When it comes to transcoding, in spite of the fact that Python and R are substantially different, we obtained reasonable success measured using various evaluation metrics and methods as described in the paper. Conclusion: Machines and human beings predominantly learn by way of similarity, a finding that can be explored further in both the machine and human learning domains.},

  abstract = {Research in cultural evolution aims at providing causal explanations for the change of culture over time. Over the past decades, this field has generated an important body of knowledge, using experimental, historical, and computational methods. While computational models have been very successful at generating testable hypotheses about the effects of several factors, such as population structure or transmission biases, some phenomena have so far been more complex to capture using agent-based and formal models. This is in particular the case for the effect of the transformations of social information induced by evolved cognitive mechanisms. We here propose that leveraging the capacity of Large Language Models (LLMs) to mimic human behavior may be fruitful to address this gap. On top of being an useful approximation of human cultural dynamics, multi-agents models featuring generative agents are also important to study for their own sake. Indeed, as artificial agents are bound to participate more and more to the evolution of culture, it is crucial to better understand the dynamics of machine-generated cultural evolution. We here present a framework for simulating cultural evolution in populations of LLMs, allowing the manipulation of variables known to be important in cultural evolution, such as network structure, personality, and the way social information is aggregated and transformed. The software we developed for conducting these simulations is open-source and features an intuitive user-interface, which we hope will help to build bridges between the fields of cultural evolution and generative artificial intelligence.},

  abstract = {As large language models (LLMs) start interacting with each other and generating an increasing amount of text online, it becomes crucial to better understand how information is transformed as it passes from one LLM to the next. While significant research has examined individual LLM behaviors, existing studies have largely overlooked the collective behaviors and information distortions arising from iterated LLM interactions. Small biases, negligible at the single output level, risk being amplified in iterated interactions, potentially leading the content to evolve towards attractor states. In a series of telephone game experiments, we apply a transmission chain design borrowed from the human cultural evolution literature: LLM agents iteratively receive, produce, and transmit texts from the previous to the next agent in the chain. By tracking the evolution of text toxicity, positivity, difficulty, and length across transmission chains, we uncover the existence of biases and attractors, and study their dependence on the initial text, the instructions, language model, and model size. For instance, we find that more open-ended instructions lead to stronger attraction effects compared to more constrained tasks. We also find that different text properties display different sensitivity to attraction effects, with toxicity leading to stronger attractors than length. These findings highlight the importance of accounting for multi-step transmission dynamics and represent a first step towards a more comprehensive understanding of LLM cultural dynamics.},

Recent machine learning methods for deriving vector-space embeddings of words have begun to garner attention for their surprising capacity to capture simple analogies consistently across large corpora, giving new life to a classic model of analogies as parallelograms that was first proposed and briefly explored by psychologists. We evaluate the parallelogram model of analogy as applied to modern data-driven word embeddings, providing a detailed analysis of the extent to which this approach captures human behavior in the domain of word pairs. Using a large novel benchmark dataset of human analogy completions, we show that word similarity alone surprisingly captures some aspects of human responses better than the parallelogram model. To gain a fine-grained picture of how well these models predict relational similarity, we also collect a large dataset of human relational similarity judgments and find that the parallelogram model captures some semantic relationships better than others. Finally, we provide evidence for deeper limitations of the parallelogram model of analogy based on the intrinsic geometric constraints of vector spaces, paralleling classic results for item similarity. Taken together, these results show that while modern word embeddings do an impressive job of capturing semantic similarity at scale, the parallelogram model alone is insufficient to account for how people form even the simplest analogies.},

  abstract = {The formation of false memories is one of the most widely studied topics in cognitive psychology. The Deese--Roediger--McDermott (DRM) paradigm is a powerful tool for investigating false memories and revealing the cognitive mechanisms subserving their formation. In this task, participants first memorize a list of words (encoding phase) and next have to indicate whether words presented in a new list were part of the initially memorized one (recognition phase). By employing DRM lists optimized to investigate semantic effects, previous studies highlighted a crucial role of semantic processes in false memory generation, showing that new words semantically related to the studied ones tend to be more erroneously recognized (compared to new words less semantically related). Despite the strengths of the DRM task, this paradigm faces a major limitation in list construction due to its reliance on human-based association norms, posing both practical and theoretical concerns. To address these issues, we developed the False Memory Generator (FMG), an automated and data-driven tool for generating DRM lists, which exploits similarity relationships between items populating a vector space. Here, we present FMG and demonstrate the validity of the lists generated in successfully replicating well-known semantic effects on false memory production. FMG potentially has broad applications by allowing for testing false memory production in domains that go well beyond the current possibilities, as it can be in principle applied to any vector space encoding properties related to word referents (e.g., lexical, orthographic, phonological, sensory, affective, etc.) or other type of stimuli (e.g., images, sounds, etc.).},

Of central interest in this line of research has been mapping out the psychological profiles of LLMs by prompting them to respond to standardized questionnaires. The conflicting findings of this research are unsurprising given that mapping out underlying, or latent, traits from LLMs' text responses to questionnaires is no easy task. To address this, we use psychometrics, the science of psychological measurement. In this study, we prompt OpenAI's flagship models, GPT-3.5 and GPT-4, to assume different personas and respond to a range of standardized measures of personality constructs. We used two kinds of persona descriptions: either generic (four or five random person descriptions) or specific (mostly demographics of actual humans from a large-scale human dataset). We found that the responses from GPT-4, but not GPT-3.5, using generic persona descriptions show promising, albeit not perfect, psychometric properties, similar to human norms, but the data from both LLMs when using specific demographic profiles, show poor psychometrics properties. We conclude that, currently, when LLMs are asked to simulate silicon personas, their responses are poor signals of potentially underlying latent traits. Thus, our work casts doubt on LLMs' ability to simulate individual-level human behaviour across multiple-choice question answering tasks.},

We tested our research question by manipulating the part of our prompt which was used to create a simulated persona with different cooperative and competitive stances. We then assessed the resulting simulacras' level of cooperation in each social dilemma, taking into account the effect of different partner conditions for the repeated game. Our results provide evidence that LLMs can, to some extent, translate natural language descriptions of different cooperative stances into corresponding descriptions of appropriate task behaviour, particularly in the one-shot game. There is some evidence of behaviour resembling conditional reciprocity for the cooperative simulacra in the repeated game, and for the later version of the model there is evidence of altruistic behaviour. Our study has potential implications for using LLM chatbots in task environments that involve cooperation, e.g. using chatbots as mediators and facilitators in public-goods negotiations.},

This environment enables the study of how ethical considerations, strategic planning, and negotiation skills impact cooperative outcomes. We develop an LLM-based agent architecture and test it with the leading open and closed LLMs. We find that all but the most powerful LLM agents fail to achieve a sustainable equilibrium in GovSim, with the highest survival rate below 54\%. Ablations reveal that successful multi-agent communication between agents is critical for achieving cooperation in these cases. Furthermore, our analyses show that the failure to achieve sustainable cooperation in most LLMs stems from their inability to formulate and analyze hypotheses about the long-term effects of their actions on the equilibrium of the group. Finally, we show that agents that leverage "Universalization"-based reasoning, a theory of moral thinking, are able to achieve significantly better sustainability.

Different drivers often perceive different levels of subjective risk under the same driving conditions. In addition, different driving conditions or driving events will have different effects on drivers. Based on these two risk perception features, in this paper, we first design an experiment on a city road with two lanes to assess the level of subjective risk perceived by drivers belonging to different groups. We then use a deep learning network-based method to abstract features of the driving environment. These environmental features are integrated with driver risk perception data and this information is used as training and testing data for the learning network. Finally, a long-short-term memory-based method is adopted to model the subjective risk perception of individual drivers based on traffic conditions and vehicle operation data from the driver's vehicle. Our results show that the proposed method can effectively model the subjective risk perception behavior of drivers, allowing for end-to-end risk perception prediction in future driving assistance systems.},

By focusing on a single relatively simple task, we are able to identify three factors that systematically affect CoT performance: the probability of the task's expected output (probability), what the model has implicitly learned during pre-training (memorization), and the number of intermediate operations involved in reasoning (noisy reasoning). We show that these factors can drastically influence task accuracy across all three LLMs; e.g., when tested with GPT-4, varying the output's probability of occurrence shifts accuracy from 26\% to 70\%. Overall, we conclude that CoT prompting performance reflects both memorization and a probabilistic version of genuine reasoning. Code and data at this https://github.com/aksh555/deciphering\_cot},

However, these models are manually designed for a specific task. Large language models (LLMs) can perform many tasks through in-context learning, but they lack the clear structure of probabilistic models. In this paper, we use chain-of-thought prompts to introduce structures from probabilistic models into LLMs. These prompts lead the model to infer latent variables and reason about their relationships to choose appropriate paraphrases for metaphors. The latent variables and relationships chosen are informed by theories of metaphor understanding from cognitive psychology. We apply these prompts to the two largest versions of GPT-3 and show that they can improve paraphrase selection.},

  abstract = {Topological data analysis (TDA) is a branch of computational mathematics, bridging algebraic topology and data science, that provides compact, noise-robust representations of complex structures. Deep neural networks (DNNs) learn millions of parameters associated with a series of transformations defined by the model architecture, resulting in highdimensional, difficult-to-interpret internal representations of input data. As DNNs become more ubiquitous across multiple sectors of our society, there is increasing recognition that mathematical methods are needed to aid analysts, researchers, and practitioners in understanding and interpreting how these models' internal representations relate to the final classification. In this paper, we apply cutting edge techniques from TDA with the goal of gaining insight into the interpretability of convolutional neural networks used for image classification. We use two common TDA approaches to explore several methods for modeling hidden-layer activations as high-dimensional point clouds, and provide experimental evidence that these point clouds capture valuable structural information about the model's process. First, we demonstrate that a distance metric based on persistent homology can be used to quantify meaningful differences between layers, and we discuss these distances in the broader context of existing representational similarity metrics for neural network interpretability. Second, we show that a mapper graph can provide semantic insight into how these models organize hierarchical class knowledge at each layer. These observations demonstrate that TDA is a useful tool to help deep learning practitioners unlock the hidden structures of their models.},

First, a target SLM augments the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) with a rich set of human-like reasoning actions to construct higher quality reasoning trajectories. Next, another SLM, with capabilities similar to the target SLM, acts as a discriminator to verify each trajectory generated by the target SLM. The mutually agreed reasoning trajectories are considered mutual consistent, thus are more likely to be correct. Extensive experiments across five SLMs demonstrate rStar can effectively solve diverse reasoning problems, including GSM8K, GSM-Hard, MATH, SVAMP, and StrategyQA. Remarkably, rStar boosts GSM8K accuracy from 12.51\% to 63.91\% for LLaMA2-7B, from 36.46\% to 81.88\% for Mistral-7B, from 74.53\% to 91.13\% for LLaMA3-8B-Instruct.

Prior work suggests that language models (LMs) often fall short on inductive reasoning, despite achieving impressive success on research benchmarks. In this work, we conduct a systematic study of the inductive reasoning capabilities of LMs through iterative hypothesis refinement, a technique that more closely mirrors the human inductive process than standard input-output prompting. Iterative hypothesis refinement employs a three-step process: proposing, selecting, and refining hypotheses in the form of textual rules. By examining the intermediate rules, we observe that LMs are phenomenal hypothesis proposers (i.e., generating candidate rules), and when coupled with a (task-specific) symbolic interpreter that is able to systematically filter the proposed set of rules, this hybrid approach achieves strong results across inductive reasoning benchmarks that require inducing causal relations, language-like instructions, and symbolic concepts. However, they also behave as puzzling inductive reasoners, showing notable performance gaps between rule induction (i.e., identifying plausible rules) and rule application (i.e., applying proposed rules to instances), suggesting that LMs are proposing hypotheses without being able to actually apply the rules. Through empirical and human analyses, we further reveal several discrepancies between the inductive reasoning processes of LMs and humans, shedding light on both the potentials and limitations of using LMs in inductive reasoning tasks.},

We conducted three rounds of the experiment and surveyed participants after each round to measure the ability of LLMs to pose as human participants without human detection. We found that participants correctly identified the nature of other users in the experiment only 42\% of the time despite knowing the presence of both bots and humans.

The author's convergent methodology ensures the conditions for making XAI purposeful and sustainable. This methodology is based on the inverse problem-solving method, cognitive modeling, genetic algorithm, neural network, causal loop dynamics, and eigenform realization. It has been shown that decision-makers need to create unique structural conditions for information processes, using LLM to accelerate the convergence of collective problem solving. The implementations have been carried out during the collective strategic planning in situational centers. The study is helpful for the advancement of explainable LLM in many branches of economy, science and technology.},

Bounded rationality may have a significant impact on the effective implementation of more sustainable technologies that are already available. However, empirical evidence on the effects of bounded rationality in the building sector, such as cognitive biases, is still lacking. Here, we present an empirical investigation of four cognitive biases in the building environment, namely the framing, anchor, default, and decoy effect. For that, energy-related decisions situations were presented to approximately 270 participants in an online survey. Our results show that awareness of greenhouse gas emissions from buildings can be raised through framing that the willingness to pay more for an energy-efficient home can be increased by presenting it as default, and that the choices can be shifted towards more energy-efficient appliances by using a decoy. The hypothesis that anchoring increases the willingness to pay more for the installation of a solar system could not be supported. These findings decrease the lack of empirical data on cognitive biases in the context of buildings and further indicate the potential of choice architecture in the building environment. The influence of cognitive biases in energy-related decisions should be used to increase the adaptation of sustainable technologies.},

Thousands of abstracts from several of the most well-known scientific journals were used to test the predictive capabilities of these detection tools, assessing abstracts from 1980 to 2023. We found that the AI text detector erroneously identified up to 8\% of the known real abstracts as AI-generated text.

However, people's perception and understanding are often distorted by their cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, anchoring bias, availability bias, to name a few. In this work, we use knowledge from the field of cognitive science to account for cognitive biases in the human-AI collaborative decision-making setting, and mitigate their negative effects on collaborative performance. To this end, we mathematically model cognitive biases and provide a general framework through which researchers and practitioners can understand the interplay between cognitive biases and human-AI accuracy. We then focus specifically on anchoring bias, a bias commonly encountered in human-AI collaboration. We implement a time-based de-anchoring strategy and conduct our first user experiment that validates its effectiveness in human-AI collaborative decision-making. With this result, we design a time allocation strategy for a resource-constrained setting that achieves optimal human-AI collaboration under some assumptions.

  abstract = {Hybrid human-ML systems increasingly make consequential decisions in a wide range of domains. These systems are often introduced with the expectation that the combined human-ML system will achieve complementary performance, that is, the combined decision-making system will be an improvement compared with either decision-making agent in isolation. However, empirical results have been mixed, and existing research rarely articulates the sources and mechanisms by which complementary performance is expected to arise. Our goal in this work is to provide conceptual tools to advance the way researchers reason and communicate about human-ML complementarity. Drawing upon prior literature in human psychology, machine learning, and human-computer interaction, we propose a taxonomy characterizing distinct ways in which human and ML-based decision-making can differ. In doing so, we conceptually map potential mechanisms by which combining human and ML decision-making may yield complementary performance, developing a language for the research community to reason about design of hybrid systems in any decision-making domain. To illustrate how our taxonomy can be used to investigate complementarity, we provide a mathematical aggregation framework to examine enabling conditions for complementarity. Through synthetic simulations, we demonstrate how this framework can be used to explore specific aspects of our taxonomy and shed light on the optimal mechanisms for combining human-ML},

We explore whether GPT, the large-language model (LLM) underlying the AI chatbot ChatGPT, can be used as a tool for automated psychological text analysis in several languages. Across 15 datasets (               n               = 47,925 manually annotated tweets and news headlines), we tested whether different versions of GPT (3.5 Turbo, 4, and 4 Turbo) can accurately detect psychological constructs (sentiment, discrete emotions, offensiveness, and moral foundations) across 12 languages. We found that GPT (               r               = 0.59 to 0.77) performed much better than English-language dictionary analysis (               r               = 0.20 to 0.30) at detecting psychological constructs as judged by manual annotators. GPT performed nearly as well as, and sometimes better than, several top-performing fine-tuned machine learning models. Moreover, GPT's performance improved across successive versions of the model, particularly for lesser-spoken languages, and became less expensive. Overall, GPT may be superior to many existing methods of automated text analysis, since it achieves relatively high accuracy across many languages, requires no training data, and is easy to use with simple prompts (e.g., ``is this text negative?'') and little coding experience. We provide sample code and a video tutorial for analyzing text with the GPT application programming interface. We argue that GPT and other LLMs help democratize automated text analysis by making advanced natural language processing capabilities more accessible, and may help facilitate more cross-linguistic research with understudied languages.},

  abstract = {Pretrained transformers exhibit the remarkable ability of in-context learning (ICL): they can learn tasks from just a few examples provided in the prompt without updating any weights. This raises a foundational question: can ICL solve fundamentally \${\textbackslash}textit\{new\}\$ tasks that are very different from those seen during pretraining? To probe this question, we examine ICL's performance on linear regression while varying the diversity of tasks in the pretraining dataset. We empirically demonstrate a \${\textbackslash}textit\{task diversity threshold\}\$ for the emergence of ICL. Below this threshold, the pretrained transformer cannot solve unseen regression tasks as it behaves like a Bayesian estimator with the \${\textbackslash}textit\{non-diverse pretraining task distribution\}\$ as the prior. Beyond this threshold, the transformer significantly outperforms this estimator; its behavior aligns with that of ridge regression, corresponding to a Gaussian prior over \${\textbackslash}textit\{all tasks\}\$, including those not seen during pretraining. These results highlight that, when pretrained on data with task diversity greater than the threshold, transformers \${\textbackslash}textit\{can\}\$ solve fundamentally new tasks in-context. Importantly, this capability hinges on it deviating from the Bayes optimal estimator with the pretraining distribution as the prior. This study underscores, in a concrete example, the critical role of task diversity, alongside data and model scale, in the emergence of ICL.

  abstract = {Cognitive science has seen a rapid evolution of the tools available for studying conceptual knowledge. Historically, much of our understanding of semantic memory has been informed through studies using language. Natural language processing (NLP) has offered groundbreaking techniques for elucidating relationships between concepts and language at unprecedented scales. One of the most popular applications has involved mathematically representing concepts using high dimensional feature spaces. Here we describe the nature of such semantic spaces and review ways in which human- and machine-generated semantic distance metrics differ in capturing taxonomic (e.g., dogwolf) versus thematic (e.g., dog-leash) semantic relationships. We propose a novel method and open-source algorithm for deriving semantic distances between adjacent content words in connected language samples. This R package transforms a userspecified language transcript into a vector of pairwise semantic distances spanning all adjacent bigrams (e.g., The cat drank the milk {$\rightarrow$} cat-drink, drink-milk, etc.). These distances constitute a continuous time series reflecting word-by-word level changes in meaning across a language sample of any length. We derive semantic distance norms and apply the proposed technique to a classic work of short fiction, To Build a Fire (Jack London, 1908). We discuss extensions of this time series approach, including the potential for forecasting, causal modeling, topic cohesion, and as an implicit measure of semantic impairment in spoken and/or written narratives.},

In this paper, a model is outlined in which the effect of performance attributions on group achievement is assumed to be mediated by the quality of group members' partner spaces (i.e. by their ability to recognize their partners' perspective on a problem). According to the model, the extent to which individuals try to take their partner's perspective is a function of their attributions for poor performance: the more group members attribute negative feedback on performance or disagreement about the correct problem solution to themselves relative to their partners, the more they will try to generate an adequate partner space. Additionally, it is assumed that the quality of the partner spaces has a direct impact on group achievement. These basic assumptions were confirmed by a study in which participants were asked to solve Tower of Hanoi problems in dyads, although attributions themselves did not directly predict achievement.},

In prior studies involving the ISM, groups typically functioned in a very specific information environment: All information items were provided in form of unique cues, which described only one of the choice alternatives among which the groups had to choose. Because this specific information environment may impact group discussions and decisions, we included an experimental condition incorporating common cues. In contrast to unique cues, common cues provide information on each and every choice option. As expected, groups in the commoncue condition showed a weaker sampling advantage for shared information, and chose the hidden-profile alternative more often than groups in the classic unique-cue condition.},

  abstract = {Previous research suggests that drivers change lanes less frequently during periods of heightened cognitive load. However, lane changing behavior of different age groups under varying levels of cognitive demand is not well understood. The majority of studies which have evaluated lane changing behavior under cognitive workload have been conducted in driving simulators. Consequently, it is unclear if the patterns observed in these simulation studies carry over to actual driving. This paper evaluates data from an on-road study to determine the effects of age and cognitive demand on lane choice and lane changing behavior. Three age groups (20--29, 40--49, and 60--69) were monitored in an instrumented vehicle. The 40's age group had 147\% higher odds of exhibiting a lane change than the 60's group. In addition, drivers in their 60's were less likely to drive on the leftmost lane compared to drivers in their 20's and 40's. These results could be interpreted as evidence that older adults adopt a more conservative driving style as reflected in being less likely to choose the leftmost lane than the younger groups and less likely to change lanes than drivers in their 40's. Regardless of demand level, cognitive workload reduced the frequency of lane changes for all age groups. This suggests that in general drivers of all ages attempt to regulate their behavior in a risk reducing direction when under added cognitive demand. The extent to which such self-regulation fully compensates for the impact of added cognitive demand remains an open question.},

Individual decisions were aggregated by using a majority decision rule (proportionality in case of ties). (1) The simulations revealed strong effects of the distribution of cue validities on group performance. When validities were linearly distributed, UWM gained an 8\% better accuracy than LEX by considering all cues. Yet, if cue validities followed a J-shaped distribution, the much more frugal LEX surpassed the UWM by achieving a 16\% higher accuracy. (2) This effect was robust across different quantities of shared information. (3) Systematic allocation of information in favour of valid or invalid cues showed that the performance of UWM mainly depended on mean validity, whereas the performance of LEX was more strongly affected by the degree to which the most valid cues were shared.},

According to this multistage view, there are contexts in which receivers first use systematic processes to derive information about expertise from argument quality and, subsequently, make use of the expertise heuristic to arrive at an attitude. We show that results of a classic study (Petty, Cacioppo, \& Goldman, 1981) are compatible with this view. Additionally, we report results of a study, in which the effect of argument quality on receivers' attitudes was partially mediated by perceived source expertise (Reimer, 2003). Two follow-up studies revealed that this mediation tended to be stronger among receivers reporting low self-expertise than among receivers reporting high selfexpertise.},

A group that has developed a routine for solving a problem does not have to negotiate about each new task and about which group member will carry out which single step of the task (Malone \& Crowstone, 1994). However, as we know from the literature on learning transfer (VanLehn, 1996) and routine decision making (Betsch, Haberstroh, \& Hoehle, 2002), acquiring a routine sometimes impairs rather than improves performance. Such a negative learning transfer is most likely if problem solvers are provided with a novel task that shares surface features with the learning task but requires a different problem solution (VanLehn, 1989). If the acquisition of a routine leads to improved group performance, crucial to continued improvement is whether groups are able to detect changes in the task environment and adequately respond to novel task demands. Are groups more likely than individuals to detect such changes and adapt their routine to novel tasks?},

The chapter applies and extends the lens model to a persuasion context. Specifically, the chapter introduces the probabilistic persuasion theory (PPT) as a framework within which the quality of arguments can be defined and measured, and the cognitive processes involved in the selection and in the reception of arguments can be modeled. Construing persuasion within the framework of PPT has the surplus value of opening the door to a rich literature on information processing models in judgment and decision making. The chapter outlines basic assumptions of the new theory, exemplify its application, and discuss its heuristic value. The chapter begins by briefly reviewing dual-process models of persuasion and how they account for the impact of arguments on attitudes. Second, the chapter critically discusses the theories' implications for human rationality, particularly their equation of heuristic processing with irrationality. Third, the chapter describes basic tenets of PPT as an alternative account of persuasion that is based on a Brunswikian framework (Hammond \& Stewart, 2001). PPT asserts that persuasion can be construed as a decision-making process, in which a communicator provides information with the goal to influence a receiver's judgments and decisions. The chapter demonstrates how PPT can be used to specify these influence processes and to study the cognitive processes involved in the selection and reception of arguments. Forth, the chapter derives five testable predictions of the new theory and describe preliminary experimental evidence in support of this account.},

However, routine problem solving always involves the risk of a negative transfer, which appears if a routine is applied to novel problems even though it is inappropriate. In this experiment, negative transfer was produced by first teaching individuals a procedure for solving the Tower of Hanoi problem. Next, participants were asked to solve several transfer tasks either individually or in pairs. However, the routine could not be applied directly to the transfer tasks but led to a long detour. As expected, the individuals surpassed the dyads, who insisted more strongly on their routine. This result fits with studies that corroborate the claim that groups are prone to a ``principle of inertia'' when solving problems or making decisions.},

This approach is used to comprehend the effectiveness of sports teams. Typically, sports teams are placed in a dynamic environment in which tasks are highly interdependent. Individual actions have to be coordinated with regard to the team objectives and with regard to the opponent team's actions. Although sports are considered behavioral tasks by their nature, performance may be strongly affected by cognitive processes. We review studies and give examples that demonstrate that the degree to which cognitions are shared and coordinated among the members of such teams influences the extent to which the individual actions are coordinated. The sharing and coordinating of cognitions pertain to the attention, information-processing, and action phases of the decision making and behavior process. We also discuss how feedback and coaching can affect information processing in teams such that coordination of actions is more likely to arise},

In contrast, when receivers are highly motivated and are able to scrutinize a message their attitude is usually affected by argument quality but is independent of the expertise cue. We argue that this does not rule out that receivers still make use of the expertise heuristic. Rather, they may consider argument quality to infer the expertise of the source. We show that a classic study (Petty, Cacioppo, \& Goldman, 1981) may be interpreted by this alternative explanation and present a study, in which the effect of argument quality on receivers' attitudes was partially mediated by perceived source expertise. This mediation tended to be stronger among receivers reporting low self-expertise than among receivers reporting high self-expertise.},

A prediction that follows is that of the less-is-more effect: Recognizing fewer cities leads, under certain conditions, to more accurate inferences than recognizing more cities. We extend the recognition heuristic to group decision-making by developing majority and lexicographic models of how recognition information is used by groups. We formally show when the less-is-more effect is predicted in groups and we present a study where three-member groups performed the population comparison task. Several aspects of our data indicate that members who can use the recognition heuristic are, not in all but in most cases, more influential in the group decision process than members who cannot use the heuristic.

Moreover, the expertise needed to integrate this prior knowledge into probabilistic modeling typically limits the application of these models to specialists. Our goal is to build a regression model that can process numerical data and make probabilistic predictions at arbitrary locations, guided by natural language text which describes a user's prior knowledge. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide a useful starting point for designing such a tool since they 1) provide an interface where users can incorporate expert insights in natural language and 2) provide an opportunity for leveraging latent problem-relevant knowledge encoded in LLMs that users may not have themselves. We start by exploring strategies for eliciting explicit, coherent numerical predictive distributions from LLMs. We examine these joint predictive distributions, which we call LLM Processes, over arbitrarily-many quantities in settings such as forecasting, multi-dimensional regression, black-box optimization, and image modeling. We investigate the practical details of prompting to elicit coherent predictive distributions, and demonstrate their effectiveness at regression. Finally, we demonstrate the ability to usefully incorporate text into numerical predictions, improving predictive performance and giving quantitative structure that reflects qualitative descriptions. This lets us begin to explore the rich, grounded hypothesis space that LLMs implicitly encode.},

Word embeddings are typically applied to linguistic and semantic tasks, however we show that word embeddings can be used to predict complex theoretically- and practically-relevant human perceptions and evaluations in domains as diverse as social cognition, health behavior, risk perception, organizational behavior, and marketing. By learning mappings from word embeddings directly onto judgment ratings, we outperform a similarity-based baseline as well as common metrics of human inter-rater reliability. Word embeddings are also able to identify the concepts that are most associated with observed perceptions and evaluations, and can thus shed light on the psychological substrates of judgment. Overall, we provide new methods and insights for predicting and understanding high-level human judgment, with important applications across the social and behavioral sciences.},

Motivated by these challenges, the current study examined whether task dynamical models of expert human herding behavior could be embedded in the control architecture of AAs to train novice actors to perform a complex multiagent herding task. Training outcomes were compared to human-expert trainers, novice baseline performance, and AAs developed using deep reinforcement learning (DRL). Participants? subjective preferences for the AAs developed using DRL or dynamical models of human performance were also investigated. The results revealed that AAs controlled by dynamical models of human expert performance could train novice actors at levels equivalent to expert human trainers and were also preferred over AAs developed using DRL. The implications for the development of AAs for robust human-AA interaction and training are discussed, including the potential benefits of employing hybrid Dynamical-DRL techniques for AA development.},

LLMs, however, lack specific knowledge about the user and their home, which limits their potential impact. SAGE (Smart Home Agent with Grounded Execution), overcomes these and other limitations by using a scheme in which a user request triggers an LLM-controlled sequence of discrete actions. These actions can be used to retrieve information, interact with the user, or manipulate device states. SAGE controls this process through a dynamically constructed tree of LLM prompts, which help it decide which action to take next, whether an action was successful, and when to terminate the process. The SAGE action set augments an LLM's capabilities to support some of the most critical requirements for a smart home assistant. These include: flexible and scalable user preference management (``Is my team playing tonight?''), access to any smart device's full functionality without device-specific code via API reading (``Turn down the screen brightness on my dryer''), persistent device state monitoring (``Remind me to throw out the milk when I open the fridge''), natural device references using only a photo of the room (``Turn on the lamp on the dresser''), and more. We introduce a benchmark of 50 new and challenging smart home tasks where SAGE achieves a 76\% success rate, significantly outperforming existing LLM-enabled baselines (30\% success rate).},

  abstract = {Property inheritance -- a phenomenon where novel properties are projected from higher level categories (e.g., birds) to lower level ones (e.g., sparrows) -- provides a unique window into how humans organize and deploy conceptual knowledge. It is debated whether this ability arises due to explicitly stored taxonomic knowledge vs. simple computations of similarity between mental representations. How are these mechanistic hypotheses manifested in contemporary language models? In this work, we investigate how LMs perform property inheritance with behavioral and causal representational analysis experiments. We find that taxonomy and categorical similarities are not mutually exclusive in LMs' property inheritance behavior. That is, LMs are more likely to project novel properties from one category to the other when they are taxonomically related and at the same time, highly similar. Our findings provide insight into the conceptual structure of language models and may suggest new psycholinguistic experiments for human subjects.},

  abstract = {Horizontal curves of rural highways are prone to a considerably high number of fatalities because an erroneous perception can lead to unsafe driving. This generally occurs when a driver fails to notice the highway geometry or changes in the driving environment, particularly curved segments. This study aimed to understand the geometric characteristics of curved segments, such as radius and approach tangents, on the driving performance towards minimizing vehicle crashes. Speed profiles and lateral position, the most common indicators of successful negotiation in curves, and eye movements were recorded during an experiment conducted in a fixed-base driving simulator equipped with an eye-tracking system with a road infrastructure (a three-lane highway) and its surroundings. A driving simulator can faithfully reproduce any situation and enable sustainable research because it is a high-tech and cost-effective tool allowing repeatability in a laboratory. The experiment was conducted with 28 drivers who covered approximately 500 test kilometers with 90 horizontal curves comprising nine different combinations of radii and approach tangent lengths. The drivers' behavior on each curve was classified as ideal, normal, intermediate, cutting, or correcting according to their trajectories and speed changes for analyses of the performance parameters and their correlation conducted by factorial ANOVA and Pearson chi-square tests. The cross-tabulation results indicated that the safest behavior significantly increased when the curve radius increased, and the performance measures of curve radii were greatly affected. However, the driving behavior was not affected by the approach tangent length. The results revealed segments of the road that require a driver's closer attention for essential vehicle control, critical information, and vehicle control in different parts of the task.},

Of 6096 registrants, 1326 met the selection criteria, of which 872 clinics had 725 relevant and operational websites. The AI assessed text from 11 771 web pages, identifying false or misleading claims in 704 (97\%) of the websites. The AI's performance was quality-assured by four human assessors, who manually reviewed 23 relevant web pages. Humans identified on average 39.5 claims likely to be judged false or misleading by advertising regulators, the AI identified 36. Humans misidentified an average of 4.8 claims, AI misidentified two. Most practitioners of pseudoscientific therapies registered with the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council make misleading health claims online. AI could support regulator efficiency.},

As humans, we exhibit systematic behavioral biases such as loss aversion, anchoring, framing, etc., which lead us to make suboptimal economic decisions. Insofar as such biases may be embedded in text data on which large language models (LLMs) are trained, to what extent are LLMs prone to the same behavioral biases? Understanding these biases in LLMs is crucial for deploying LLMs to support human decision-making. We propose utility theory---a paradigm at the core of modern economic theory---as an approach to evaluate the economic biases of LLMs. Utility theory enables the quantification and comparison of economic behavior against benchmarks such as perfect rationality or human behavior. To demonstrate our approach, we quantify and compare the economic behavior of a variety of open- and closed-source LLMs. We find that the economic behavior of current LLMs is neither entirely human-like nor entirely economicus-like. We also find that most current LLMs struggle to maintain consistent economic behavior across settings. Finally, we illustrate how our approach can measure the effect of interventions such as prompting on economic biases.},

These rules are often algorithmically rich but are nonetheless acquired with minimal data and computation. Symbolic models based on program learning successfully explain rule-learning in many domains, but performance degrades quickly as program complexity increases. It remains unclear how to scale symbolic rule-learning methods to model human performance in challenging domains. Here we show that symbolic search over the space of metaprograms---programs that revise programs---dramatically improves learning efficiency. On a behavioral benchmark of 100 algorithmically rich rules, this approach fits human learning more accurately than alternative models while also using orders of magnitude less search. The computation required to match median human performance is consistent with conservative estimates of human thinking time. Our results suggest that metaprogram-like representations may help human learners to efficiently acquire rules.},

We annotate each board in the dataset with action-values provided by the powerful Stockfish 16 engine, leading to roughly 15 billion data points. Our largest model reaches a Lichess blitz Elo of 2895 against humans, and successfully solves a series of challenging chess puzzles, without any domain-specific tweaks or explicit search algorithms. We also show that our model outperforms AlphaZero's policy and value networks (without MCTS) and GPT-3.5-turbo-instruct. A systematic investigation of model and dataset size shows that strong chess performance only arises at sufficient scale.

  abstract = {Compositionality has long been considered a key explanatory property underlying human intelligence: arbitrary concepts can be composed into novel complex combinations, permitting the acquisition of an open ended, potentially infinite expressive capacity from finite learning experiences. Influential arguments have held that neural networks fail to explain this aspect of behavior, leading many to dismiss them as viable models of human cognition. Over the last decade, however, modern deep neural networks (DNNs)---which share the same fundamental design principles as their predecessors---have come to dominate artificial intelligence, exhibiting the most advanced cognitive behaviors ever demonstrated in machines. In particular, large language models (LLMs), DNNs trained to predict the next word on a large corpus of text, have proven capable of sophisticated behaviors such as writing syntactically complex sentences without grammatical errors, producing cogent chains of reasoning, and even writing original computer programs---all behaviors thought to require compositional processing. In this chapter, we survey recent empirical work from machine learning for a broad audience in philosophy, cognitive science, and neuroscience, situating recent breakthroughs in deep learning and LLMs within the broader context of philosophical arguments about compositionality. In particular, our review emphasizes two approaches to endowing neural networks with compositional generalization capabilities: (1) architectural inductive biases, and (2) metalearning, or learning to learn. We also present findings suggesting that LLM pretraining can be understood as a kind of metalearning, and can thereby equip DNNs with compositional generalization abilities in a similar way. We conclude by discussing the implications that these findings may have for the study of compositionality in human cognition and by suggesting avenues for future research.},

In tasks governed by succinct rules, learning is more robust when related examples are blocked across trials, but in the absence of such rules, interleaving is more effective. To date, no neural model has simultaneously captured these seemingly contradictory effects. Here we show that this same tradeoff spontaneously emerges with "in-context learning" (ICL) both in neural networks trained with metalearning and in large language models (LLMs). ICL is the ability to learn new tasks "in context" - without weight changes - via an inner-loop algorithm implemented in activation dynamics. Experiments with pretrained LLMs and metalearning transformers show that ICL exhibits the blocking advantage demonstrated in humans on a task involving rule-like structure, and conversely, that concurrent in-weight learning reproduces the interleaving advantage observed in humans on tasks lacking such structure.},

We do this by prefixing the prompt with a persona that is associated either with a social identity or domain expertise. In a multi-armed bandit task, we find that LLMs pretending to be children of different ages recover human-like developmental stages of exploration. In a language-based reasoning task, we find that LLMs impersonating domain experts perform better than LLMs impersonating non-domain experts. Finally, we test whether LLMs' impersonations are complementary to visual information when describing different categories. We find that impersonation can improve performance: an LLM prompted to be a bird expert describes birds better than one prompted to be a car expert. However, impersonation can also uncover LLMs' biases: an LLM prompted to be a man describes cars better than one prompted to be a woman. These findings demonstrate that LLMs are capable of taking on diverse roles and that this in-context impersonation can be used to uncover their hidden strengths and biases.},

Here, we introduce AI-aided brainstorming for solving guesstimation problems, i.e. estimating quantities from incomplete information, as a testbed for human-AI interaction with large language models (LLMs). In a think-aloud study, we found that humans decompose guesstimation questions into sub-questions and often replace them with semantically related ones. If they fail to brainstorm related questions, they often get stuck and do not find a solution. Therefore, to support this brainstorming process, we prompted a large language model (GPT-3) with successful replacements from our think-aloud data. In follow-up studies, we tested whether the availability of this tool improves participants' answers. While the tool successfully produced human-like suggestions, participants were reluctant to use it. From our findings, we conclude that for human-AI interaction with LLMs to be successful AI-systems must complement rather than mimic a user's associations.},

  abstract = {Objective: This paper introduces a robust, real-time system for detecting driver lane changes. Background: As intelligent transportation systems evolve to assist drivers in their intended behaviors, the systems have demonstrated a need for methods of inferring driver intentions and detecting intended maneuvers. Method: Using a ?model tracing? methodology, our system simulates a set of possible driver intentions and their resulting behaviors using a simplification of a previously validated computational model of driver behavior. The system compares the model's simulated behavior with a driver's actual observed behavior and thus continually infers the driver's unobservable intentions from her or his observable actions. Results: For data collected in a driving simulator, the system detects 82\% of lane changes within 0.5 s of maneuver onset (assuming a 5\% false alarm rate), 93\% within 1 s, and 95\% before the vehicle moves one fourth of the lane width laterally. For data collected from an instrumented vehicle, the system detects 61\% within 0.5 s, 77\% within 1 s, and 84\% before the vehicle moves one-fourth of the lane width laterally. Conclusion: The model-tracing system is the first system to demonstrate high sample-by-sample accuracy at low false alarm rates as well as high accuracy over the course of a lane change with respect to time and lateral movement. Application: By providing robust real-time detection of driver lane changes, the system shows good promise for incorporation into the next generation of intelligent transportation systems.},

  abstract = {Objective: This paper explores the development of a rigorous computational model of driver behavior in a cognitive architecture--a computational framework with underlying psychological theories that incorporate basic properties and limitations of the human system. Background: Computational modeling has emerged as a powerful tool for studying the complex task of driving, allowing researchers to simulate driver behavior and explore the parameters and constraints of this behavior. Method: An integrated driver model developed in the ACT-R (Adaptive Control of Thought-Rational) cognitive architecture is described that focuses on the component processes of control, monitoring, and decision making in a multilane highway environment. Results: This model accounts for the steering profiles, lateral position profiles, and gaze distributions of human drivers during lane keeping, curve negotiation, and lane changing. Conclusion: The model demonstrates how cognitive architectures facilitate understanding of driver behavior in the context of general human abilities and constraints and how the driving domain benefits cognitive architectures by pushing model development toward more complex, realistic tasks. Application: The model can also serve as a core computational engine for practical applications that predict and recognize driver behavior and distraction.},

  abstract = {This dissertation studies the emergence of Transactive Memory Systems (TMS), specifically the shared knowledge structure component of TMS. To this end, the first part of the project provides in-depth discussions around the theoretical and methodological integration of the TMS and broader teams literatures, the alignment of theoretical and empirical TMS definitions, and the need to study communication in depth as the mechanism through which TMS develops. In the second part of the dissertation, the principles of these discussions were applied to build a computational model of TMS shared knowledge structure emergence in R. Each simulation ran for 100 iterations to study whether communication between agents regarding their areas of expertise resulted in the emergence of the TMS shared knowledge structure. Decision-making and deep learning theories were drawn on to predict that when agents did not have overlap in areas of expertise (had some overlap in areas of expertise), selecting to communicate with the team member thought most likely to be an expert in an information area led to more favorable (less favorable) outcomes than selecting which team member to communicate with randomly. The simulation was repeated for seven learning rates representing how readily agents changed their perceptions about their team members. Results indicated that query and response regarding expertise areas of agents consistently led to the emergence of a TMS shared knowledge structure across conditions. In most instances the pattern of emergence was marked by an initial period of rapid emergence followed by a decrease in the emergence rate. The results supported the hypotheses that when there is no expertise overlap, selecting maximally would lead to a more emerged shared knowledge structure than searching randomly, while the opposite would be the found when there was some expertise overlap. The latter finding challenges the assumption present in the TMS literature that searching for information maximally whenever possible is preferable. It seems that searching randomly allowed agents to gather information that contradicted their misconceptions and when some information could be found with more than one team member, this ultimately led to being better able to learn their team members' areas of expertise.},

According to police records, human error plays a major role in the occurrence of accidents. The aim of this study is to analyze the potential types of human error that contribute to traffic accidents, as well as the psychological factors that underlie traffic accidents experienced by car drivers and motorcyclists. Data was collected by interviewing five car drivers and five motorcyclists. Results show that the car drivers tend to perform a type of human error which is classified as lapses, while the motorcyclists tend to do an error of slips. For psychological factors that underlie traffic accident, results show that both car drivers and motorcyclists made recognition errors, i.e. did not estimate distance, time, and speed. They also made decision errors, i.e. did not avoid the situation immediately, and performance errors, i.e. a motorcyclist stepped on the gas pedal by mistake. Other errors done by the car drivers were being sleepy and drunk, whereas other errors done by motorcyclists were not having a riding license and feeling tired. The implication of this study is to make the drivers/riders aware of the importance of cognitive aspects in driving.},

When tested, their accuracy is often on par with average neurotypical adults, challenging long-standing critiques of associative models. Here we analyse recent findings at the intersection of LLMs and cognitive science. Here we discuss how modern LLMs resurrect associationist principles, with abilities like long-distance associations enabling complex reasoning. While limitations remain in areas like causal cognition and planning, phenomena like emergence suggest room for growth. Providing examples and increasing the dimensions of the network are methods that further improve LLM abilities, mirroring facilitation effects in human cognition. Analysis of LLMs errors provides insight into human cognitive biases. Overall, we argue LLMs represent a promising development for cognitive modelling, enabling new explorations of the mechanisms underlying intelligence and reasoning from an associationist point of view. Carefully evaluating LLMs with the tools of cognitive psychology will further understand the building blocks of the human mind.},

The autonomous teammate made an ethical or unethical action during each mission, followed by an apology or denial. Measures of individual team trust, autonomous teammate trust, human teammate trust, perceived autonomous teammate ethicality, and team performance were taken.ResultsTeams with unethical autonomous teammates had significantly lower trust in the team and trust in the autonomous teammate. Unethical autonomous teammates were also perceived as substantially more unethical. Neither trust repair strategy effectively restored trust after an ethical violation, and autonomous teammate ethicality was not related to the team score, but unethical autonomous teammates did have shorter times.ConclusionEthical violations significantly harm trust in the overall team and autonomous teammate but do not negatively impact team score. However, current trust repair strategies like apologies and denials appear ineffective in restoring trust after this type of violation.ApplicationThis research highlights the need to develop trust repair strategies specific to human-AI teams and trust violations of an ethical nature.},

This poses major problems for conservation efforts, while also presenting an interesting case study in human perception. Since many forms of energy used are not directly perceptible, and since the amount of energy that is being used by an appliance is often difficult to infer from appearances alone, people often rely on cues. Some of these cues are more reliable than others and previous literature has investigated which of these cues people rely on. However, past literature has always studied these proximal cues in isolation---despite the fact that, during real-world perception, people are always integrating a variety of cues. Here, we investigate how people rely on a variety of cues, and how individual differences in the reliance on those cues predicts the ability to estimate home energy use.},

They can switch between independent and collective modes of behavior, and flexible switching can be advantageous for adapting to ongoing changes in conditions. In the present study, we investigated the flexibility between independent and collective modes of behavior in a simulated social foraging task designed to benefit from both modes: distancing among ten foraging agents promoted faster detection of resources, whereas flocking promoted faster consumption. There was a tradeoff between faster detection versus faster consumption, but both factors contributed to foraging success. Results showed that group foraging performance among simulated agents was enhanced by~loose coupling~that balanced distancing and flocking among agents and enabled them to fluidly switch among a variety of groupings. We also examined the effects of more sophisticated cognitive capacities by studying how human players improve performance when they control one of the search agents. Results showed that human intervention further enhanced group performance with loosely coupled agents, and human foragers performed better when coordinating with loosely coupled agents. Humans players adapted their balance of independent versus collective search modes in response to the dynamics of simulated agents, thereby demonstrating the importance of adaptive flexibility in social foraging.},

This study explores the potential of LLMs to augment judgement in forecasting tasks. We evaluated the impact on forecasting accuracy of two GPT-4-Turbo assistants: one designed to provide high-quality advice (`superforecasting'), and the other designed to be overconfident and base-rate-neglecting. Participants (N = 991) had the option to consult their assigned LLM assistant throughout the study, in contrast to a control group that used a less advanced model (DaVinci-003) without direct forecasting support. Our preregistered analyses reveal that LLM augmentation significantly enhances forecasting accuracy by 23\% across both types of assistants, compared to the control group. This improvement occurs despite the superforecasting assistant's higher accuracy in predictions, indicating the augmentation's benefit is not solely due to model prediction accuracy. Exploratory analyses showed a pronounced effect in one forecasting item, without which we find that the superforecasting assistant increased accuracy by 43\%, compared with 28\% for the biased assistant. We further examine whether LLM augmentation disproportionately benefits less skilled forecasters, degrades the wisdom-of-the-crowd by reducing prediction diversity, or varies in effectiveness with question difficulty. Our findings do not consistently support these hypotheses. Our results suggest that access to an LLM assistant, even a biased one, can be a helpful decision aid in cognitively demanding tasks where the answer is not known at the time of interaction.},

Past work on the forecasting ability of large language models (LLMs) suggests that frontier LLMs, as individual forecasters, underperform compared to the gold standard of a human crowd forecasting tournament aggregate. In Study 1, we expand this research by using an LLM ensemble approach consisting of a crowd of twelve LLMs. We compare the aggregated LLM predictions on 31 binary questions to that of a crowd of 925 human forecasters from a three-month forecasting tournament. Our preregistered main analysis shows that the LLM crowd outperforms a simple no-information benchmark and is not statistically different from the human crowd. In exploratory analyses, we find that these two approaches are equivalent with respect to medium-effect-size equivalence bounds. We also observe an acquiescence effect, with mean model predictions being significantly above 50\%, despite an almost even split of positive and negative resolutions. Moreover, in Study 2, we test whether LLM predictions (of GPT-4 and Claude 2) can be improved by drawing on human cognitive output. We find that both models' forecasting accuracy benefits from exposure to the median human prediction as information, improving accuracy by between 17\% and 28\%: though this leads to less accurate predictions than simply averaging human and machine forecasts. Our results suggest that LLMs can achieve forecasting accuracy rivaling that of human crowd forecasting tournaments: via the simple, practically applicable method of forecast aggregation. This replicates the `wisdom of the crowd' effect for LLMs, and opens up their use for a variety of applications throughout society.},

  abstract = {The concept of heuristic decision making is adapted to dynamic influence processes in social networks. We report results of a set of simulations, in which we systematically varied: a) the agents' strategies for contacting fellow group members and integrating collected information, and (b) features of their social environment --- the distribution of members' status, and the degree of clustering in their network. As major outcome variables, we measured the speed with which the process settled, the distributions of agents' final preferences, and the rate with which high-status members changed their initial preferences. The impact of the agents' decision strategies on the dynamics and outcomes of the influence process depended on features of their social environment. This held in particular true when agents contacted all of the neighbors with whom they were connected. When agents focused on high-status members and did not contact low-status neighbors, the process typically settled more quickly, yielded larger majority factions and fewer preference changes. A case study exemplifies the empirical application of the model.},

  abstract = {Background and objective: Researchers commonly use automated solutions such as Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems to extract clinical information from large volumes of unstructured data. However, clinical text's poor semantic structure and domain-specific vocabulary can make it challenging to develop a one-size-fits-all solution. Large Language Models (LLMs), such as OpenAI's Generative Pre-Trained Transformer 3 (GPT-3), offer a promising solution for capturing and standardizing unstructured clinical information. This study evaluated the performance of InstructGPT, a family of models derived from LLM GPT-3, to extract relevant patient information from medical case reports and discussed the advantages and disadvantages of LLMs versus dedicated NLP methods. Methods: In this paper, 208 articles related to case reports of foreign body injuries in children were identified by searching PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. A reviewer manually extracted information on sex, age, the object that caused the injury, and the injured body part for each patient to build a gold standard to compare the performance of InstructGPT. Results: InstructGPT achieved high accuracy in classifying the sex, age, object and body part involved in the injury, with 94\%, 82\%, 94\% and 89\%, respectively. When excluding articles for which InstructGPT could not retrieve any information, the accuracy for determining the child's sex and age improved to 97\%, and the accuracy for identifying the injured body part improved to 93\%. InstructGPT was also able to extract information from non-English language articles. Conclusions: The study highlights that LLMs have the potential to eliminate the necessity for task-specific training (zero-shot extraction), allowing the retrieval of clinical information from unstructured natural language text, particularly from published scientific literature like case reports, by directly utilizing the PDF file of the article without any pre-processing and without requiring any technical expertise in NLP or Machine Learning. The diverse nature of the corpus, which includes articles written in languages other than English, some of which contain a wide range of clinical details while others lack information, adds to the strength of the study.},

We present a new class of associative nets we call Dynamic-Eigen-Nets, and provide simulations that show how they generalize to patterns that are structurally aligned with the training domain. Linear-Associative-Nets respond with the same pattern regardless of input, motivating the introduction of saturation to facilitate other response states. However, models using saturation cannot readily generalize to novel, but structurally aligned patterns. Dynamic-Eigen-Nets address this problem by dynamically biasing the eigenspectrum towards external input using temporary weight changes. We demonstrate how a two-slot Dynamic-Eigen-Net trained on a text corpus provides an account of bigram judgment-of-grammaticality and lexical decision tasks, showing it can better capture syntactic regularities from the corpus compared to the Brain-State-in-a-Box and the Linear-Associative-Net. We end with a simulation showing how a Dynamic-Eigen-Net is sensitive to syntactic violations introduced in bigrams, even after the associations that encode those bigrams are deleted from memory. Over all simulations, the Dynamic-Eigen-Net reliably outperforms the Brain-State-in-a-Box and the Linear-Associative-Net. We propose Dynamic-Eigen-Nets as associative nets that generalize at retrieval, instead of encoding, through recurrent feedback.},

  abstract = {Grounding language in vision is an active field of research seeking to construct cognitively plausible word and sentence representations by incorporating perceptual knowledge from vision into text-based representations. Despite many attempts at language grounding, achieving an optimal equilibrium between textual representations of the language and our embodied experiences remains an open field. Some common concerns are the following. Is visual grounding advantageous for abstract words, or is its effectiveness restricted to concrete words? What is the optimal way of bridging the gap between text and vision? To what extent is perceptual knowledge from images advantageous for acquiring high-quality embeddings? Leveraging the current advances in machine learning and natural language processing, the present study addresses these questions by proposing a simple yet very effective computational grounding model for pre-trained word embeddings. Our model effectively balances the interplay between language and vision by aligning textual embeddings with visual information while simultaneously preserving the distributional statistics that characterize word usage in text corpora. By applying a learned alignment, we are able to indirectly ground unseen words including abstract words. A series of evaluations on a range of behavioral datasets shows that visual grounding is beneficial not only for concrete words but also for abstract words, lending support to the indirect theory of abstract concepts. Moreover, our approach offers advantages for contextualized embeddings, such as those generated by BERT (Devlin et al, 2018), but only when trained on corpora of modest, cognitively plausible sizes. Code and grounded embeddings for English are available at (https://github.com/Hazel1994/Visually\_Grounded\_Word\_Embeddings\_ 2).},

  abstract = {This paper explores the dual role of Large Language Models (LLMs) in the context of online misinformation and disinformation. In today's digital landscape, where the internet and social media facilitate the rapid dissemination of information, discerning between accurate content and falsified information presents a formidable challenge. Misinformation, often arising unintentionally, and disinformation, crafted deliberately, are at the forefront of this challenge. LLMs such as OpenAI's GPT-4, equipped with advanced language generation abilities, present a double-edged sword in this scenario. While they hold promise in combating misinformation by fact-checking and detecting LLM-generated text, their ability to generate realistic, contextually relevant text also poses risks for creating and propagating misinformation. Further, LLMs are plagued with many problems such as biases, knowledge cutoffs, and hallucinations, which may further perpetuate misinformation and disinformation. The paper outlines historical developments in misinformation detection and how it affects social media consumption, especially among youth, and introduces LLMs and their applications in various domains. It then critically analyzes the potential of LLMs to generate and counter misinformation and disinformation in sensitive topics such as healthcare, COVID-19, and political agendas. Further, it discusses mitigation strategies, ethical considerations, and regulatory measures, summarizing previous methods and proposing future research direction toward leveraging the benefits of LLMs while minimizing misuse risks. The paper concludes by acknowledging LLMs as powerful tools with significant implications in both spreading and combating misinformation in the digital age.},

We investigate cases where the belief state geometry is represented in the final residual stream or distributed across the residual streams of multiple layers, providing a framework to explain these observations. Furthermore we demonstrate that the inferred belief states contain information about the entire future, beyond the local next-token prediction that the transformers are explicitly trained on. Our work provides a framework connecting the structure of training data to the computational structure and representations that transformers use to carry out their behavior.},

Fifteen months after the baseline measurements, we collected information about the current driving status of the participants. Results Forty-eight participants (1.7\%) ceased driving during the 15-month period following the assessment. Logistic regression models identified the following as significant predictors of driving cessation: performance on the trail-making test (parts A and B), digit symbol substitution test scores, story memory, and flanker task scores for the total, congruent, and incongruent conditions. The flanker task scores for the total, congruent, and incongruent conditions were significant predictors in the fully adjusted logistic model. Conclusion The flanker task was more important than assessments of general cognition, including memory, attention, executive control, and processing speed, in predicting driving cessation.

Despite this, no evaluations have shown that LLM systems can take the very first step of producing novel, expert-level ideas, let alone perform the entire research process. We address this by establishing an experimental design that evaluates research idea generation while controlling for confounders and performs the first head-to-head comparison between expert NLP researchers and an LLM ideation agent. By recruiting over 100 NLP researchers to write novel ideas and blind reviews of both LLM and human ideas, we obtain the first statistically significant conclusion on current LLM capabilities for research ideation: we find LLM-generated ideas are judged as more novel (p {$<$} 0.05) than human expert ideas while being judged slightly weaker on feasibility. Studying our agent baselines closely, we identify open problems in building and evaluating research agents, including failures of LLM self-evaluation and their lack of diversity in generation. Finally, we acknowledge that human judgements of novelty can be difficult, even by experts, and propose an end-to-end study design which recruits researchers to execute these ideas into full projects, enabling us to study whether these novelty and feasibility judgements result in meaningful differences in research outcome.},

Yet, recent advances in generative AI may change this situation through new forms of human-AI collaboration. This paper investigates how teams of players interact with an AI assistant in the PIRCC game Codenames and the impact this has on cognition, social dynamics, and player experience. We observed gameplay and conducted post-game focus groups with 54 participants across ten groups. Each group played three rounds of Codenames, with an AI assistant supporting Cluegivers. We found the AI assistant enhanced players' convergent and divergent thinking, but interfered with formation of team mental models, highlighting a tension in the use of AI in creative team scenarios. The presence of the AI challenged many players' understanding of the 'spirit of the game'. Furthermore, the presence of the AI assistants weakened social connections between human teammates, but strengthened connections across teams. This paper provides an empirical account of an AI assistant's effect on cognition, social dynamics, and player experience in Codenames. We highlight the opportunities and challenges that arise when designing hybrid digital boardgames that include AI assistants.},

  abstract = {Industry 4.0 comes with the human-autonomy teaming (HAT) paradigm. Autonomous agents and operators are working as teammates with complementary competencies. Agents can make proposals thanks to new sensor technologies and data analyzing methods. The operator's new task is to accept or reject these proposals. Consequently, trust is central in an HAT environment. This experiment aims to understand the effects of agent-generated information on the operators' decision-making, trust, and risk perception during cooperation operations. This cooperation aims to help operators to manage maintenance dates in a maritime context. To this end, participants formed a team with a predictive maintenance system that provided them with proposals for modifying the schedule. In each situation, participants had to decide whether to comply with the proposal or not. The variables modified were agent transparency (transparency about analytical uncertainty and/or environmental projections) and situation criticality (moderate or high). The participants' trust, risk perception, and compliance were measured. The results show that trust is a predictor of decision-making and risk perception is a moderator of trust. Transparency and situation criticality, and their interaction, influence participants' trust and risk perception. These effects are also present in participants' compliance. Notably, transparency in the environmental projections with a high-criticality situation leads to lower compliance. Agent transparency and situation criticality play an important role in operator decision-making and trust building. As transparency helps improve HAT, situation criticality must be taken into account for a better understanding of its effects.},

Grid-linked technologies vary widely in form and function, but generally share common potentials: to reduce energy consumption via efficiency and/or curtailment, to shift use to off-peak times of day, and to enable distributed storage and generation options. Although end users are central players in these systems, they are sometimes not central considerations in technology or program design, and in some cases, their motivations for participating in such systems are not fully appreciated. Behavioral science can be instrumental in engaging end-users and maximizing the impact of smart grid technologies.

  abstract = {PURPOSE               Use of artificial intelligence (AI) in cancer care is increasing. What remains unclear is how best to design patient-facing systems that communicate AI output. With oncologist input, we designed an interface that presents patient-specific, machine learning--based 6-month survival prognosis information designed to aid oncology providers in preparing for and discussing prognosis with patients with advanced solid tumors and their caregivers. The primary purpose of this study was to assess patient and caregiver perceptions and identify enhancements of the interface for communicating 6-month survival and other prognosis information when making treatment decisions concerning anticancer and supportive therapy.                                         METHODS               This qualitative study included interviews and focus groups conducted between November and December 2022. Purposive sampling was used to recruit former patients with cancer and/or former caregivers of patients with cancer who had participated in cancer treatment decisions from Utah or elsewhere in the United States. Categories and themes related to perceptions of the interface were identified.                                         RESULTS               We received feedback from 20 participants during eight individual interviews and two focus groups, including four cancer survivors, 13 caregivers, and three representing both. Overall, most participants expressed positive perceptions about the tool and identified its value for supporting decision making, feeling less alone, and supporting communication among oncologists, patients, and their caregivers. Participants identified areas for improvement and implementation considerations, particularly that oncologists should share the tool and guide discussions about prognosis with patients who want to receive the information.                                         CONCLUSION               This study revealed important patient and caregiver perceptions of and enhancements for the proposed interface. Originally designed with input from oncology providers, patient and caregiver participants identified additional interface design recommendations and implementation considerations to support communication about prognosis.                        ,              Cancer patient and caregiver perceptions affect interface design for sharing AI-based prognosis.},

However, despite providing many clear benefits, barriers remain towards their integration into academic work. Ethical and practical concerns regarding their suitability for various tasks further complicate their appropriate use. Here, we summarise recent literature assessing the capacity of LLMs for different components of academic research and teaching, focusing on three key areas in the psychological sciences: education and assessment, academic writing, and simulating human behaviour. We discuss how LLMs can be used to aid each area, describe current challenges and good practices, and propose future directions. In doing so, we aim to increase the awareness and proper use of LLMs in various components of academic work, which will only feature more heavily over time.},

A central challenge in the interaction of humans with AI is the estimation of difficulty for human and AI agents for single task instances.These estimations are crucial to evaluate each agent's capabilities and, thus, required to facilitate effective collaboration. So far, research in the field of human-AI interaction estimates the perceived difficulty of humans and AI independently from each other. However, the effective interaction of human and AI agents depends on metrics that accurately reflect each agent's perceived difficulty in achieving valuable outcomes. Research to date has not yet adequately examined the differences in the perceived difficulty of humans and AI. Thus, this work reviews recent research on the perceived difficulty in human-AI interaction and contributing factors to consistently compare each agent's perceived difficulty, e.g., creating the same prerequisites. Furthermore, we present an experimental design to thoroughly examine the perceived difficulty of both agents and contribute to a better understanding of the design of such systems.},

Recently, Large Language Models (LLMs) have been shown to be able to simulate human reasoning. We extend this work by measuring LLMs' ability to simulate strategic reasoning in the ultimatum game -- a classic economics bargaining experiment. Experimental evidence shows human strategic reasoning is complex -- people will often choose to ``punish" other players to enforce social norms even at personal expense. We test if LLMs can replicate this behavior in simulation, comparing two structures: single LLMs and multi-agent systems. We compare their abilities to (1) simulate human-like reasoning in the ultimatum game, (2) simulate two player personalities, greedy and fair, and (3) create robust strategies that are logically complete and consistent with personality. Our evaluation shows that multi-agent systems are more accurate than single LLMs (88\% vs. 50\%) in simulating human reasoning and actions for personality pairs. Thus, there is potential to use LLMs to simulate human strategic reasoning to help decision and policy-makers perform preliminary explorations of how people behave in systems.},

These models focus their learning on low-dimensional error metrics, for example average distance between model-generated and observed trajectories. Such metrics permit relative comparison of models, but do not provide clearly interpretable information on how close to human behavior the models actually come, for example in terms of higher-level behavior phenomena that are known to be present in human driving. We study highway driving as an example scenario, and introduce metrics to quantitatively demonstrate the presence, in a naturalistic dataset, of two familiar behavioral phenomena: (1) The kinematics-dependent contest, between on-highway and on-ramp vehicles, of who passes the merging point first. (2) Courtesy lane changes away from the outermost lane, to leave space for a merging vehicle. Applying the exact same metrics to the output of a state-of-the-art machine-learned model, we show that the model is capable of reproducing the former phenomenon, but not the latter. We argue that this type of behavioral analysis provides information that is not available from conventional model-fitting metrics, and that it may be useful to analyze (and possibly fit) models also based on these types of behavioral criteria.},

The study aimed to investigate potential differences in cognitive load, as well as the quality and homogeneity of the students' recommendations and justifications. Results indicated that students using LLMs experienced significantly lower cognitive load. However, despite this reduction, these students demonstrated lower-quality reasoning and argumentation in their final recommendations compared to those who used traditional search engines. Further, the homogeneity of the recommendations and justifications did not differ significantly between the two groups, suggesting that LLMs did not restrict the diversity of students' perspectives. These findings highlight the nuanced implications of digital tools on learning, suggesting that while LLMs can decrease the cognitive burden associated with information gathering during a learning task, they may not promote deeper engagement with content necessary for high-quality learning per se.},

At the same time, research on the public acceptance of AI shows that many people feel quite apprehensive about the potential of such technologies---an observation that has been connected to both demographic and sociocultural user variables (e.g., age, previous media exposure). Yet, due to divergent and often ad-hoc measurements of AI-related attitudes, the current body of evidence remains inconclusive. Likewise, it is still unclear if attitudes towards AI are also affected by users' personality traits. In response to these research gaps, we offer a two-fold contribution. First, we present a novel, psychologically informed questionnaire (ATTARI-12) that captures attitudes towards AI as a single construct, independent of specific contexts or applications. Having observed good reliability and validity for our new measure across two studies (N1\,=\,490; N2\,=\,150), we examine several personality traits---the Big Five, the Dark Triad, and conspiracy mentality---as potential predictors of AI-related attitudes in a third study (N3\,=\,298). We find that agreeableness and younger age predict a more positive view towards artificially intelligent technology, whereas the susceptibility to conspiracy beliefs connects to a more negative attitude. Our findings are discussed considering potential limitations and future directions for research and practice.},

Recent research shows that large language models (LLMs) can solve various forms of analogies. However, can LLMs generalize analogy solving to new domains like people can? To investigate this, we had children, adults, and LLMs solve a series of letter-string analogies (e.g., a b : a c :: j k : ?) in the Latin alphabet, in a near transfer domain (Greek alphabet), and a far transfer domain (list of symbols). As expected, children and adults easily generalized their knowledge to unfamiliar domains, whereas LLMs did not. This key difference between human and AI performance is evidence that these LLMs still struggle with robust human-like analogical transfer.},

In many of these applications, there is strong motivation to develop hybrid systems in which humans and AI algorithms can work together, leveraging their complementary strengths and weaknesses. We develop a Bayesian framework for combining the predictions and different types of confidence scores from humans and machines. The framework allows us to investigate the factors that influence complementarity, where a hybrid combination of human and machine predictions leads to better performance than combinations of human or machine predictions alone. We apply this framework to a large-scale dataset where humans and a variety of convolutional neural networks perform the same challenging image classification task. We show empirically and theoretically that complementarity can be achieved even if the human and machine classifiers perform at different accuracy levels as long as these accuracy differences fall within a bound determined by the latent correlation between human and machine classifier confidence scores. In addition, we demonstrate that hybrid human--machine performance can be improved by differentiating between the errors that humans and machine classifiers make across different class labels. Finally, our results show that eliciting and including human confidence ratings improve hybrid performance in the Bayesian combination model. Our approach is applicable to a wide variety of classification problems involving human and machine algorithms.},

Recent work has focused on the quality of internal LLM confidence assessments, but the question remains of how well LLMs can communicate this internal model confidence to human users. This paper explores the disparity between external human confidence in an LLM's responses and the internal confidence of the model. Through experiments involving multiple-choice questions, we systematically examine human users' ability to discern the reliability of LLM outputs. Our study focuses on two key areas: (1) assessing users' perception of true LLM confidence and (2) investigating the impact of tailored explanations on this perception. The research highlights that default explanations from LLMs often lead to user overestimation of both the model's confidence and its' accuracy. By modifying the explanations to more accurately reflect the LLM's internal confidence, we observe a significant shift in user perception, aligning it more closely with the model's actual confidence levels. This adjustment in explanatory approach demonstrates potential for enhancing user trust and accuracy in assessing LLM outputs. The findings underscore the importance of transparent communication of confidence levels in LLMs, particularly in high-stakes applications where understanding the reliability of AI-generated information is essential.},

First, the conditions that support complementarity (i.e., situations in which the performance of a human with AI assistance exceeds the performance of an unassisted human or the AI in isolation) must be understood. This task requires humans to be able to recognize situations in which the AI should be leveraged and to develop new AI systems that can learn to complement the human decision-maker. Second, human mental models of the AI, which contain both expectations of the AI and reliance strategies, must be accurately assessed. Third, the effects of different design choices for human-AI interaction must be understood, including both the timing of AI assistance and the amount of model information that should be presented to the human decision-maker to avoid cognitive overload and ineffective reliance strategies. In response to each of these three challenges, we present an interdisciplinary perspective based on recent empirical and theoretical findings and discuss new research directions.},

When mining texts, the implied assumption is that analysts can find kernels of truth--they just have to sift through the rubbish first. In this book, Dustin Stoltz and Marshall Taylor encourage text analysts to work with a different metaphor in mind: mapping. When mapping texts, the goal is not necessarily to find meaningful needles in the haystack, but instead to create reductions of the text to document patterns. Just like with cartographic maps, though, the type and nature of the textual map is dependent on a range of decisions on the part of the researcher. Creating reproducible workflows is therefore critical for the text analyst.  Mapping Texts offers a practical introduction to computational text analysis with step-by-step guides on how to conduct actual text analysis workflows in the R statistical computing environment. The focus is on social science questions and applications, with data ranging from fake news and presidential campaigns to Star Trek and pop stars. The book walks the reader through all facets of a text analysis workflow--from understanding the theories of language embedded in text analysis, all the way to more advanced and cutting-edge techniques.

Whether this capability extends beyond text to other modalities remains unclear. Humans possess a sophisticated ability to read the mind in the eyes of other people. Here we tested whether this ability is also present in GPT-4o, a multimodal LLM. Using two versions of a widely used theory of mind test, the Reading the Mind in Eyes Test and the Multiracial Reading the Mind in the Eyes Test, we found that GPT-4o outperformed humans in interpreting mental states from upright faces but underperformed humans when faces were inverted. While humans in our sample showed no difference between White and Non-white faces, GPT-4o's accuracy was higher for White than for Non-white faces. GPT-4o's errors were not random but revealed a highly consistent, yet incorrect, processing of mental-state information across trials, with an orientation-dependent error structure that qualitatively differed from that of humans for inverted faces but not for upright faces. These findings highlight how advanced mental state inference abilities and human-like face processing signatures, such as inversion effects, coexist in GPT-4o alongside substantial differences in information processing compared to humans.},

  abstract = {At the core of what defines us as humans is the concept of theory of mind: the ability to track other people's mental states. The recent development of large language models (LLMs) such as ChatGPT has led to intense debate about the possibility that these models exhibit behaviour that is indistinguishable from human behaviour in theory of mind tasks. Here we compare human and LLM performance on a comprehensive battery of measurements that aim to measure different theory of mind abilities, from understanding false beliefs to interpreting indirect requests and recognizing irony and faux pas. We tested two families of LLMs (GPT and LLaMA2) repeatedly against these measures and compared their performance with those from a sample of 1,907 human participants. Across the battery of theory of mind tests, we found that GPT-4 models performed at, or even sometimes above, human levels at identifying indirect requests, false beliefs and misdirection, but struggled with detecting faux pas. Faux pas, however, was the only test where LLaMA2 outperformed humans. Follow-up manipulations of the belief likelihood revealed that the superiority of LLaMA2 was illusory, possibly reflecting a bias towards attributing ignorance. By contrast, the poor performance of GPT originated from a hyperconservative approach towards committing to conclusions rather than from a genuine failure of inference. These findings not only demonstrate that LLMs exhibit behaviour that is consistent with the outputs of mentalistic inference in humans but also highlight the importance of systematic testing to ensure a non-superficial comparison between human and artificial intelligences.},

Worse still, documenting experimental design is time-consuming and error-prone, making the replication of experiments difficult or impossible. To address these issues, we introduce and evaluate an open-source method for automating the generation and documentation of experimental designs. This method combines natural language processing (NLP) with SweetPea, a declarative programming language in Python that synthesizes unbiased experimental sequences. Specifically, we leverage the NLP model GTP-3 to translate experimental designs between English and SweetPea. Our evaluations indicate that translating between the two formats is accurate across a broad range of designs but is increasingly error-prone as design complexity increases. We conclude by discussing current limitations in our approach as well as potential extensions and applications.},

A central issue is our limited grasp of how human cognitive processes begin with a goal and form intentions for executing actions, a blindspot even in established interaction models such as Norman's gulfs of execution and evaluation. To address this gap, we theorize how end-users 'envision' translating their goals into clear intentions and craft prompts to obtain the desired LLM response. We define a process of Envisioning by highlighting three misalignments: (1) knowing whether LLMs can accomplish the task, (2) how to instruct the LLM to do the task, and (3) how to evaluate the success of the LLM's output in meeting the goal.

  abstract = {Biological and artificial information processing systems form representations of the world that they can use to categorize, reason, plan, navigate, and make decisions. How can we measure the extent to which the representations formed by these diverse systems agree? Do similarities in representations then translate into similar behavior? And if so, then how can a system's representations be modified to better match those of another system? These questions pertaining to the study of representational alignment are at the heart of some of the most active research areas in contemporary cognitive science, neuroscience, and machine learning. For example, cognitive scientists seek to measure the representational alignment of multiple individuals to identify shared cognitive priors, neuroscientists seek to align fMRI responses from multiple individuals into a shared representational space to boost the signal for group-level analyses, and machine learning researchers seek to distill knowledge from large teacher models into small student models by increasing their representational alignment. Unfortunately, there is limited knowledge transfer between research communities interested in representational alignment, so progress in one field often ends up being rediscovered independently in another. Thus, greater cross-field communication would be advantageous. To improve communication between fields, we propose a unifying framework that can serve as a common language between researchers studying representational alignment. We survey the literature from the fields of cognitive science, neuroscience, and machine learning, and demonstrate how prior work fits into this framework. Finally, we lay out open problems in representational alignment where progress can benefit all three of these fields. We hope that our work can catalyze cross-disciplinary collaboration and accelerate progress for all communities studying and developing information processing systems. We note that this is a working paper and encourage readers to reach out with their suggestions for future revisions.},

To address this issue, here we deploy automated analyses of large-scale experiments based on adversarial collective-sensing games, which pit teams against each other in a competition to discover and extract resources from a shared environment. By inserting human participants and artificial agents with configurable strategies into these games, we gain experimental control over the environment and social landscape.

To address this challenge, we draw on the rich history of agent design in symbolic artificial intelligence to develop a blueprint for a new wave of cognitive language agents. We first show that LLMs have many of the same properties as production systems, and recent efforts to improve their grounding or reasoning mirror the development of cognitive architectures built around production systems. We then propose Cognitive Architectures for Language Agents (CoALA), a conceptual framework to systematize diverse methods for LLM-based reasoning, grounding, learning, and decision making as instantiations of language agents in the framework. Finally, we use the CoALA framework to highlight gaps and propose actionable directions toward more capable language agents in the future.},

  abstract = {Automatic response forecasting for news media plays a crucial role in enabling content producers to efficiently predict the impact of news releases and prevent unexpected negative outcomes such as social conflict and moral injury. To effectively forecast responses, it is essential to develop measures that leverage the social dynamics and contextual information surrounding individuals, especially in cases where explicit profiles or historical actions of the users are limited (referred to as lurkers). As shown in a previous study, 97\% of all tweets are produced by only the most active 25\% of users. However, existing approaches have limited exploration of how to best process and utilize these important features. To address this gap, we propose a novel framework, named SocialSense, that leverages a large language model to induce a belief-centered graph on top of an existent social network, along with graph-based propagation to capture social dynamics. We hypothesize that the induced graph that bridges the gap between distant users who share similar beliefs allows the model to effectively capture the response patterns. Our method surpasses existing state-of-the-art in experimental evaluations for both zero-shot and supervised settings, demonstrating its effectiveness in response forecasting. Moreover, the analysis reveals the framework's capability to effectively handle unseen user and lurker scenarios, further highlighting its robustness and practical applicability.},

  abstract = {Traditionally, machine learning algorithms relied on reliable labels from experts to build predictions. More recently however, algorithms have been receiving data from the general population in the form of labeling, annotations, etc. The result is that algorithms are subject to bias that is born from ingesting unchecked information, such as biased samples and biased labels. Furthermore, people and algorithms are increasingly engaged in interactive processes wherein neither the human nor the algorithms receive unbiased data. Algorithms can also make biased predictions, leading to what is now known as algorithmic bias. On the other hand, human's reaction to the output of machine learning methods with algorithmic bias worsen the situations by making decision based on biased information, which will probably be consumed by algorithms later. Some recent research has focused on the ethical and moral implication of machine learning algorithmic bias on society. However, most research has so far treated algorithmic bias as a static factor, which fails to capture the dynamic and iterative properties of bias. We argue that algorithmic bias interacts with humans in an iterative manner, which has a long-term effect on algorithms' performance. For this purpose, we present an iterated-learning framework that is inspired from human language evolution to study the interaction between machine learning algorithms and humans. Our goal is to study two sources of bias that interact: the process by which people select information to label (human action); and the process by which an algorithm selects the subset of information to present to people (iterated algorithmic bias mode). We investigate three forms of iterated algorithmic bias (personalization filter, active learning, and random) and how they affect the performance of machine learning algorithms by formulating research questions about the impact of each type of bias. Based on statistical analyses of the results of several controlled experiments, we found that the three different iterated bias modes, as well as initial training data class imbalance and human action, do affect the models learned by machine learning algorithms. We also found that iterated filter bias, which is prominent in personalized user interfaces, can lead to more inequality in estimated relevance and to a limited human ability to discover relevant data. Our findings indicate that the relevance blind spot (items from the testing set whose predicted relevance probability is less than 0.5 and who thus risk being hidden from humans) amounted to 4\% of all relevant items when using a content-based filter that predicts relevant items. A similar simulation using a real-life rating data set found that the same filter resulted in a blind spot size of 75\% of the relevant testing set.},

Our study analyzed 1) a language model that generates the survey responses that correspond with a human group based solely on its demographic distribution and 2) the applicability of our methodology across various demographic subgroups and thematic questions. Through random silicon sampling and using only group-level demographic information, we discovered that language models can generate response distributions that are remarkably similar to the actual U.S. public opinion polls. Moreover, we found that the replicability of language models varies depending on the demographic group and topic of the question, and this can be attributed to inherent societal biases in the models. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of mirroring a group's opinion using only demographic distribution and elucidate the effect of social biases in language models on such simulations.},

Recently, the emergence of generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) has made Large Language Model (LLM) powered conversational agents such as ChatGPT a viable alternative for health information search. However, while trust is crucial for adopting the online health advice, the factors influencing people's trust judgments in health information provided by LLM-powered conversational agents remain unclear. To address this, we conducted a mixed-methods, within-subjects lab study (N=21) to explore how interactions with different agents (ChatGPT vs. Google) across three health search tasks influence participants' trust judgments of the search results as well as the search agents themselves. Our key findings showed that: (a) participants' trust levels in ChatGPT were significantly higher than Google in the context of health information seeking; (b) there is a significant correlation between trust in health-related information and trust in the search agent, however only for Google; (c) the type of search tasks did not affect participants' perceived trust; and (d) participants' prior knowledge, the style of information presentation, and the interactive manner of using search agents were key determinants of trust in the health-related information. Our study taps into differences in trust perceptions when using traditional search engines compared to LLM-powered conversational agents. We highlight the potential role LLMs play in health-related information-seeking contexts, where they excel as stepping stones for further search.

For many years, such use involved extracting vector-space representations of words and using distances among these to predict or understand human behavior in various semantic tasks. In contemporary language models, however, it is possible to interrogate the latent structure of conceptual representations using methods nearly identical to those commonly used with human participants. The current work uses three common techniques borrowed from cognitive psychology to estimate and compare lexical-semantic structure in both humans and a well-known large language model, the DaVinci variant of GPT-3. In humans, we show that conceptual structure is robust to differences in culture, language, and method of estimation. Structures estimated from the LLM behavior, while individually fairly consistent with those estimated from human behavior, depend much more upon the particular task used to generate behavior responses--responses generated by the very same model in the three tasks yield estimates of conceptual structure that cohere less with one another than do human structure estimates. The results suggest one important way that knowledge inhering in contemporary LLMs can differ from human cognition.},

  abstract = {A Large Language Model (LLM) is an artificial intelligence system trained on vast amounts of natural language data, enabling it to generate human-like responses to written or spoken language input. Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT)-3.5 is an example of an LLM that supports a conversational agent called ChatGPT. In this work, we used a series of novel prompts to determine whether ChatGPT shows heuristics and other context-sensitive responses. We also tested the same prompts on human participants. Across four studies, we found that ChatGPT was influenced by random anchors in making estimates (anchoring, Study 1); it judged the likelihood of two events occurring together to be higher than the likelihood of either event occurring alone, and it was influenced by anecdotal information (representativeness and availability heuristic, Study 2); it found an item to be more efficacious when its features were presented positively rather than negatively---even though both presentations contained statistically equivalent information (framing effect, Study 3); and it valued an owned item more than a newly found item even though the two items were objectively identical (endowment effect, Study 4). In each study, human participants showed similar effects. Heuristics and context-sensitive responses in humans are thought to be driven by cognitive and affective processes such as loss aversion and effort reduction. The fact that an LLM---which lacks these processes---also shows such responses invites consideration of the possibility that language is sufficiently rich to carry these effects and may play a role in generating these effects in humans.},

  abstract = {In-context learning (ICL) is one of the most powerful and most unexpected capabilities to emerge in recent transformer-based large language models (LLMs). Yet the mechanisms that underlie it are poorly understood. In this paper, we demonstrate that comparable ICL capabilities can be acquired by an alternative sequence prediction learning method using clone-structured causal graphs (CSCGs). Moreover, a key property of CSCGs is that, unlike transformer-based LLMs, they are \{{\textbackslash}em interpretable\}, which considerably simplifies the task of explaining how ICL works. Specifically, we show that it uses a combination of (a) learning template (schema) circuits for pattern completion, (b) retrieving relevant templates in a context-sensitive manner, and (c) rebinding of novel tokens to appropriate slots in the templates. We go on to marshall evidence for the hypothesis that similar mechanisms underlie ICL in LLMs. For example, we find that, with CSCGs as with LLMs, different capabilities emerge at different levels of overparameterization, suggesting that overparameterization helps in learning more complex template (schema) circuits. By showing how ICL can be achieved with small models and datasets, we open up a path to novel architectures, and take a vital step towards a more general understanding of the mechanics behind this important capability.},

  abstract = {In settings where users both need high accuracy and are timepressured, such as doctors working in emergency rooms, we want to provide AI assistance that both increases decision accuracy and reduces decision-making time. Current literature focusses on how users interact with AI assistance when there is no time pressure, finding that different AI assistances have different benefits: some can reduce time taken while increasing overreliance on AI, while others do the opposite. The precise benefit can depend on both the user and task. In time-pressured scenarios, adapting when we show AI assistance is especially important: relying on the AI assistance can save time, and can therefore be beneficial when the AI is likely to be right. We would ideally adapt what AI assistance we show depending on various properties (of the task and of the user) in order to best trade off accuracy and time. We introduce a study where users have to answer a series of logic puzzles. We find that time pressure affects how users use different AI assistances, making some assistances more beneficial than others when compared to notime-pressure settings. We also find that a user's overreliance rate is a key predictor of their behaviour: overreliers and not-overreliers use different AI assistance types differently. We find marginal correlations between a user's overreliance rate (which is related to the user's trust in AI recommendations) and their personality traits (Big Five Personality traits). Overall, our work suggests that AI assistances have different accuracy-time tradeoffs when people are under time pressure compared to no time pressure, and we explore how we might adapt AI assistances in this setting.},

We measured the N400, an index of semantic access, to words of varying probability, including unpredictable words. Word predictability was measured using both cloze probabilities and a state-of-the-art machine learning language model (GPT-2). We reanalyzed five datasets (n~=~138) to demonstrate and then replicate that context-based facilitation on the N400 is graded, even among unpredictable words. Furthermore, we established that the relationship between word predictability and context-based facilitation combines linear and logarithmic functions. We argue that this composite function reveals properties of the mapping between words and semantic features and how feature- and word-related information is activated on-line.},

A common approach to evaluating LLMs is to use metrics, or criteria, which are assertions used to assess performance that help ensure that their outputs align with domain-specific standards. Previous efforts have involved developers, lay users, or the LLMs themselves in creating these criteria, however, evaluation particularly from a domain expertise perspective, remains understudied. This study explores how domain experts contribute to LLM evaluation by comparing their criteria with those generated by LLMs and lay users. We further investigate how the criteria-setting process evolves, analyzing changes between a priori and a posteriori stages. Our findings emphasize the importance of involving domain experts early in the evaluation process while utilizing complementary strengths of lay users and LLMs. We suggest implications for designing workflows that leverage these strengths at different evaluation stages.},

However, existing models may not be applicable for scheduled, non-time-critical takeovers as drivers take longer to resume control when there is no time pressure. A model of driver response time in non-time-critical takeovers is lacking.MethodA computational cognitive model of driver takeover response time is developed based on Queuing Network-Model Human Processor (QN-MHP) architecture. The model quantifies gaze redirection in response to takeover request (ToR), task prioritization, driver situation awareness, and driver trust to address the complexities of drivers' takeover strategies when sufficient time budget exists.ResultsExperimental data of a preliminary driving simulator study were used to validate the model. The model accounted for 97\% of the experimental takeover response time for freeway exiting.ConclusionThe current model can successfully predict drivers? response time for scheduled, non-time-critical freeway exiting takeovers in conditionally AVs.ApplicationThis model can be applied to the human-machine interface design with respect to ToR lead time for enhancing safe freeway exiting takeovers in conditionally AVs.

Further study shows that an advanced LLM like GPT-4 can consistently map between statistical and estimative uncertainty, but a significant performance gap remains.

Specifically, we present and compare different models that are based on well-known machine learning (ML) methods. Data for training the models were collected using a static driving simulator, with real human subjects performing a specific secondary task [i.e., a surrogate visual research task (SURT)] while driving. Different training methods, model characteristics, and feature selection criteria have been compared. Based on our results, using a support vector machine (SVM) has outperformed all the other ML methods, providing the highest classification rate for most of the subjects. Potential applications of this paper include the design of an adaptive IVIS and of a ``smarter'' PADAS.},

Our findings indicate a tendency for LLM agents to conform to the model's inherent social biases despite being directed to debate from certain political perspectives. This tendency results in behavioral patterns that seem to deviate from well-established social dynamics among humans. We reinforce these observations using an automatic self-fine-tuning method, which enables us to manipulate the biases within the LLM and demonstrate that agents subsequently align with the altered biases. These results underscore the need for further research to develop methods that help agents overcome these biases, a critical step toward creating more realistic simulations.},

Thus, it is significant to investigate human vision systems with great potential to improve assistive, and even autonomous, vehicular technologies.

Further, based on the framework, we develop a fully convolutional neural network to estimate the salient region in a novel driving scene.

  abstract = {AI assistance is readily available to humans in a variety of decision-making applications. In order to fully understand the efficacy of such joint decision-making, it is important to first understand the human's reliance on AI. However, there is a disconnect between how joint decision-making is studied and how it is practiced in the real world. More often than not, researchers ask humans to provide independent decisions before they are shown AI assistance. This is done to make explicit the influence of AI assistance on the human's decision. We develop a cognitive model that allows us to infer the latent reliance strategy of humans on AI assistance without asking the human to make an independent decision. We validate the model's predictions through two behavioral experiments. The first experiment follows a concurrent paradigm where humans are shown AI assistance alongside the decision problem. The second experiment follows a sequential paradigm where humans provide an independent judgment on a decision problem before AI assistance is made available. The model's predicted reliance strategies closely track the strategies employed by humans in the two experimental paradigms. Our model provides a principled way to infer reliance on AI-assistance and may be used to expand the scope of investigation on human-AI collaboration.},

  abstract = {Humans use AI-assistance in a wide variety of high- and low-stakes decision-making tasks today. However, human reliance on the AI's assistance is often sub-optimal --- with people exhibiting under- or over-reliance on the AI. We present an empirical investigation of human-AI assisted decision-making in a noisy image classification task. We analyze the participants' reliance on AI assistance and the accuracy of human-AI assistance as compared to the human or AI working independently. We demonstrate that participants do not show automation bias which is a widely reported behavior displayed by humans when assisted by AI. In this specific instance of AI-assisted decision-making, people are able to correctly override the AI's decision when needed and achieve close to the theoretical upper bound on combined performance. We suggest that the reason for this discrepancy from previous research findings is because 1) people are experts at classifying everyday images and have a good understanding of their ability in performing the task, 2) people engage in the metacognitive act of deliberation when asked to indicate confidence in their decision, and 3) people were able to build a good mental model of the AI by incorporating feedback that was provided after each trial. These findings should inform future experiment design.},

Similarly, confidence may also be used to indicate the reliability of advice given by an AI. While previous work on explainable AI (XAI) has explored the effect of AI confidence on AI-advice adoption and joint accuracy of the human-AI team, most studies use AI-assistants that exceed human performance. It is unclear how displaying the confidence interacts with the accuracy of the AI. We conduct a comprehensive investigation of the effect of displaying AI confidence on two factors: 1) the accuracy of AI-assisted decision making, and 2) reliance on the AI's assistance. We conduct two behavioral experiments, one where participants were shown AI confidence, and another where no confidence ratings were shown. Our work goes beyond the typical focus on high accuracy AI assistants. In both experiments, participants were assisted by one of three AI classifiers of varying accuracy. Our results demonstrate that displaying AI confidence increases joint accuracy when people are assisted by a classifier that is better than humans on average. Conversely, when assisted by a classifier with performance worse than an average human, joint accuracy was better when no AI confidence was displayed. However, for the adoption of AI advice we observed the opposite pattern: people rely more on a higher accuracy classifier that does not display confidence compared to one that does, and people rely more on a lower accuracy classifier that does display AI confidence compared to one that does not.},

In this paper, we argue that datasets of this sort represent a useful and underexplored source to validate, complement, and enhance cognitive studies on human behavior and language use. We present a method that leverages the recent development of powerful computational models to obtain the fine-grained annotation required to apply metrics and techniques from Cognitive Science to large datasets. Previous work in Cognitive Science has investigated the question-asking strategies of human participants by employing different variants of the so-called 20-question-game setting and proposing several evaluation methods. In our work, we focus on GuessWhat, a task proposed within the Computer Vision and Natural Language Processing communities that is similar in structure to the 20-question-game setting. Crucially, the GuessWhat dataset contains tens of thousands of dialogues based on real-world images, making it a suitable setting to investigate the question-asking strategies of human players on a large scale and in a natural setting. Our results demonstrate the effectiveness of computational tools to automatically code how the hypothesis space changes throughout the dialogue in complex visual scenes. On the one hand, we confirm findings from previous work on smaller and more controlled settings. On the other hand, our analyses allow us to highlight the presence of ``uninformative'' questions (in terms of Expected Information Gain) at specific rounds of the dialogue. We hypothesize that these questions fulfill pragmatic constraints that are exploited by human players to solve visual tasks in complex scenes successfully. Our work illustrates a method that brings together efforts and findings from different disciplines to gain a better understanding of human question-asking strategies on large-scale datasets, while at the same time posing new questions about the development of conversational systems.},

Despite its success, there are few available opportunities for training and professional development for adult tutors. Furthermore, the task of assessing tutor performance during actual tutoring sessions is challenging and time-consuming for human evaluators---enter artificial intelligence (AI). In this work, we harness generative AI, specifically large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4, to introduce an innovative approach for delivering tutors real-time, explanatory feedback while tutors engage in online scenariobased lessons. Hosted within the Personalized Learning Squared (PLUS) tutoring platform, these lessons offer tutors opportunities to practice responding to common tutoring scenarios. For example, in the Giving Effective Praise lesson, tutors practice responding to students by providing praise and then receiving immediate and templated feedback generated by LLMs. Beyond demonstrating tutor training containing AI-generated feedback, we report past work using LLMs to assess tutors providing praise, revealing moderate performance, and explaining several prompting methods. While using generative AI shows promise as a low-cost and efficient method for giving adult tutors feedback on their performance in training and actual tutoring, it is not without limitations. Practical and ethical considerations are discussed. Human tutoring remains a robust and irreplaceable influence on student learning, with generative AI serving as a valuable tool to complement tutors and enhance the impact of tutoring on student learning.},

  abstract = {The use of natural language interfaces (NLIs) for the creation of charts is becoming increasingly popular due to the intuitiveness of natural language interactions. One key challenge in this approach is to accurately capture user intents and transform them to proper chart specifications. This obstructs the wide use of NLI in chart generation, as users' natural language inputs are generally abstract (i.e., ambiguous or under-specified), without a clear specification of visual encodings. Recently, pre-trained large language models (LLMs) have exhibited superior performance in understanding and generating natural language, demonstrating great potential for downstream tasks. Inspired by this major trend, we propose ChartGPT, generating charts from abstract natural language inputs. However, LLMs are struggling to address complex logic problems. To enable the model to accurately specify the complex parameters and perform operations in chart generation, we decompose the generation process into a step-by-step reasoning pipeline, so that the model only needs to reason a single and specific sub-task during each run. Moreover, LLMs are pre-trained on general datasets, which might be biased for the task of chart generation. To provide adequate visualization knowledge, we create a dataset consisting of abstract utterances and charts and improve model performance through fine-tuning. We further design an interactive interface for ChartGPT that allows users to check and modify the intermediate outputs of each step. The effectiveness of the proposed system is evaluated through quantitative evaluations and a user study.},

We look to survey design, where human response biases caused by changes in the wordings of ``prompts'' have been extensively explored in social psychology literature. Drawing from these works, we design a dataset and framework to evaluate whether LLMs exhibit human-like response biases in survey questionnaires. Our comprehensive evaluation of nine models shows that popular open and commercial LLMs generally fail to reflect human-like behavior, particularly in models that have undergone RLHF. Furthermore, even if a model shows a significant change in the same direction as humans, we find that they are sensitive to perturbations that do not elicit significant changes in humans. These results highlight the pitfalls of using LLMs as human proxies, and underscore the need for finer-grained characterizations of model behavior.1},

Behavioural traces, i.e. evidence of other people's pro-environmental behaviour left in the shared environment, have shown to influence people towards being more pro-environmental. However, systematic research into behavioural traces of PEBs is missing. In a set of three surveys, we investigate which behavioural traces correspond to a number of pro- and anti-environmental behaviours identified from previous literature, how frequently these behavioural traces are encountered, their relation with engagement in behaviours, and whether behaviours can be inferred from traces. All studies are survey-based with a mix of open-ended questions (Surveys 1 \& 3) and rating scales (Survey 2). We use network analysis to identify partial correlations between behaviours and traces. A total of 66 traces uniquely attributed to 36 pro- and anti-environmental behaviours were identified. On average, each trace is observed monthly. Noticing traces correlated with engaging in related behaviours in 24 instances. Participants report that if they saw a trace more frequently, they expect they would be more likely to adopt the behaviour that produced the trace. Finally, participants were generally able to infer the causing behaviours when only presented the traces. We show that unique behavioural traces exist for a number of pro- and anti-environmental behaviours. Traces are noticed and relate to the constituting behaviours based on correlational and self-report evidence. Because of the wide variation between behaviours and their traces, further research into specific behaviours is warranted. Use of these findings for interventions are discussed.},

But designing social media platforms to promote better conversations is inherently challenging. This paper asks whether simulating social media through a combination of Large Language Models (LLM) and Agent-Based Modeling can help researchers study how different news feed algorithms shape the quality of online conversations. We create realistic personas using data from the American National Election Study to populate simulated social media platforms. Next, we prompt the agents to read and share news articles - and like or comment upon each other's messages - within three platforms that use different news feed algorithms. In the first platform, users see the most liked and commented posts from users whom they follow. In the second, they see posts from all users - even those outside their own network. The third platform employs a novel "bridging" algorithm that highlights posts that are liked by people with opposing political views. We find this bridging algorithm promotes more constructive, non-toxic, conversation across political divides than the other two models. Though further research is needed to evaluate these findings, we argue that LLMs hold considerable potential to improve simulation research on social media and many other complex social settings.},

  abstract = {One way to address safety risks from large language models (LLMs) is to censor dangerous knowledge from their training data. While this removes the explicit information, implicit information can remain scattered across various training documents. Could an LLM infer the censored knowledge by piecing together these implicit hints? As a step towards answering this question, we study inductive out-of-context reasoning (OOCR), a type of generalization in which LLMs infer latent information from evidence distributed across training documents and apply it to downstream tasks without in-context learning. Using a suite of five tasks, we demonstrate that frontier LLMs can perform inductive OOCR. In one experiment we finetune an LLM on a corpus consisting only of distances between an unknown city and other known cities. Remarkably, without in-context examples or Chain of Thought, the LLM can verbalize that the unknown city is Paris and use this fact to answer downstream questions. Further experiments show that LLMs trained only on individual coin flip outcomes can verbalize whether the coin is biased, and those trained only on pairs \$(x,f(x))\$ can articulate a definition of \$f\$ and compute inverses. While OOCR succeeds in a range of cases, we also show that it is unreliable, particularly for smaller LLMs learning complex structures. Overall, the ability of LLMs to "connect the dots" without explicit in-context learning poses a potential obstacle to monitoring and controlling the knowledge acquired by LLMs.},

  abstract = {Humans can attribute beliefs to others. However, it is unknown to what extent this ability results from an innate biological endowment or from experience accrued through child development, particularly exposure to language describing others' mental states. We test the viability of the language exposure hypothesis by assessing whether models exposed to large quantities of human language display sensitivity to the implied knowledge states of characters in written passages. In pre-registered analyses, we present a linguistic version of the False Belief Task to both human participants and a large language model, GPT-3. Both are sensitive to others' beliefs, but while the language model significantly exceeds chance behavior, it does not perform as well as the humans nor does it explain the full extent of their behavior---despite being exposed to more language than a human would in a lifetime. This suggests that while statistical learning from language exposure may in part explain how humans develop the ability to reason about the mental states of others, other mechanisms are also responsible.},

While some believe that LLMs capture the ``wisdom of the crowd''---due to their vast training data---empirical evidence for this hypothesis remains scarce. We present a novel methodological framework to test this: the ``number needed to beat'' (NNB), which measures how many humans are needed for a sample's quality to rival the quality achieved by GPT-4, a state-of-the-art LLM. In a series of pre-registered experiments, we collect novel human data and demonstrate the utility of this method for four psycholinguistic datasets for English. We find that NNB \&gt; 1 for each dataset, but also that NNB varies across tasks (and in some cases is quite small, e.g., 2). We also introduce two ``centaur'' methods for combining LLM and human data, which outperform both stand-alone LLMs and human samples. Finally, we analyze the trade-offs in data cost and quality for each approach. While clear limitations remain, we suggest that this framework could guide decision-making about whether and how to integrate LLM-generated data into the research pipeline.},

Over the past decade, it has been repeatedly demonstrated that extreme prevalence (both high and low) leads to an increase in errors. While this ``prevalence effect'' is well established, the cognitive and/or perceptual mechanisms responsible for it are not. One reason for this is that the most common tool for analyzing prevalence effects, Signal Detection Theory, cannot distinguish between different biases that might be present. Through an application to pathology image-based decisionmaking, we illustrate that an evidence accumulation modeling framework can be used to disentangle different types of biases. Importantly, our results show that prevalence influences both response expectancy and stimulus evaluation biases, with novices (students, N = 96) showing a more pronounced response expectancy bias and experts (medical laboratory professionals, N = 19) showing a more pronounced stimulus evaluation bias.},

For this study we collected a bank of hundreds of digital images that were identified by cell type and classified by difficulty by a panel of expert hematopathologists. The key manipulations in our study included examining the speed-accuracy tradeoff as well as the impact of prior expectations on decisions. In addition, our study examined individual differences in decision-making by comparing task performance to domain general visual ability (as measured using the Novel Object Memory Test (NOMT) (Richler et al. Cognition 166:42--55, 2017). Using signal detection theory and the diffusion decision model (DDM), we found many similarities between experts and novices in our task. While experts tended to have better discriminability, the two groups responded similarly to time pressure (i.e., reduced caution under speed instructions in the DDM) and to the introduction of a probabilistic cue (i.e., increased response bias in the DDM). These results have important implications for training in this area as well as using novice participants in research on medical image perception and decision-making.},

Prior work has developed theories to describe how people assign responsibility to individuals in teams. However, there has been little work studying the cognitive processes that underlie responsibility judgments in human-AI collaborations, especially for tasks comprising a sequence of interdependent actions. In this work, we take a step towards filling this gap. Using semiautonomous driving as a paradigm, we develop an environment that simulates stylized cases of human-AI collaboration using a generative model of agent behavior. We propose a model of responsibility that considers how unexpected an agent's action was, and what would have happened had they acted differently. We test the model's predictions empirically and find that in addition to action expectations and counterfactual considerations, participants' responsibility judgments are also affected by how much each agent actually contributed to the outcome.},

However, high accuracy can be achieved in many ways. The particular decision function found by a machine learning system is determined not only by the data to which the system is exposed, but also the inductive biases of the model, which are typically harder to characterize. In this work, we follow a recent trend of in-depth behavioral analyses of neural network models that go beyond accuracy as an evaluation metric by looking at patterns of errors. Our focus is on comparing a suite of standard Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and a recently-proposed attention-based network, the Vision Transformer (ViT), which relaxes the translation-invariance constraint of CNNs and therefore represents a model with a weaker set of inductive biases. Attention-based networks have previously been shown to achieve higher accuracy than CNNs on vision tasks, and we demonstrate, using new metrics for examining error consistency with more granularity, that their errors are also more consistent with those of humans. These results have implications both for building more human-like vision models, as well as for understanding visual object recognition in humans.},

Shared information acts as a recruitment signal and facilitates the formation of a self-organized group. Thus, the improved search efficiency of the collective bestows byproduct benefits onto the original sharer. A key mechanism is a visibility radius, where individuals have unconditional access to information about neighbors within a limited distance. Our results show that for a variety of initial conditions---including populations initially devoid of prosocial individuals---and across both static and dynamic fitness landscapes, we find strong selection pressure to evolve unconditional sharing.},

Participants (N\,=\,1875) were embedded in networks (n\,=\,125) of 15 nodes to which we sometimes added 2 bots.

We first confirm that groups are better able to explore a semantic space than isolated individuals. Then we show that when bots that share the most similar noun operate in groups facing a semantic space that is relatively easy to navigate, group performance is superior.

Here we addressed this question by conducting a preregistered systematic review and meta-analysis of 106 experimental studies reporting 370 effect sizes. We searched an interdisciplinary set of databases (the Association for Computing Machinery Digital Library, the Web of Science and the Association for Information Systems eLibrary) for studies published between 1 January 2020 and 30 June 2023. Each study was required to include an original human-participants experiment that evaluated the performance of humans alone, AI alone and human--AI combinations. First, we found that, on average, human--AI combinations performed significantly worse than the best of humans or AI alone (Hedges' g\,=\,-0.23; 95\% confidence interval, -0.39 to -0.07). Second, we found performance losses in tasks that involved making decisions and significantly greater gains in tasks that involved creating content. Finally, when humans outperformed AI alone, we found performance gains in the combination, but when AI outperformed humans alone, we found losses. Limitations of the evidence assessed here include possible publication bias and variations in the study designs analysed. Overall, these findings highlight the heterogeneity of the effects of human--AI collaboration and point to promising avenues for improving human--AI systems.},

Human and GPT-2 LM predictions are strongly aligned in the first presentation of a text span, but their performance quickly diverges when memory (or in-context learning) begins to play a role. We traced the cause of this divergence to specific attention heads in a middle layer. Adding a power-law recency bias to these attention heads yielded a model that performs much more similarly to humans.

The contemporary field of AI, however, has taken the theoretical possibility of explaining human cognition as a form of computation to imply the practical feasibility of realising human(-like or -level) cognition in factual computational systems, and the field frames this realisation as a short-term inevitability. Yet, as we formally prove herein, creating systems with human(-like or -level) cognition is intrinsically computationally intractable. This means that any factual AI systems created in the short-run are at best decoys. When we think these systems capture something deep about ourselves and our thinking, we induce distorted and impoverished images of ourselves and our cognition. In other words, AI in current practice is deteriorating our theoretical understanding of cognition rather than advancing and enhancing it. The situation could be remediated by releasing the grip of the currently dominant view on AI and by returning to the idea of AI as a theoretical tool for cognitive science. In reclaiming this older idea of AI, however, it is important not to repeat conceptual mistakes of the past (and present) that brought us to where we are today.},

  abstract = {This paper considers how interactions with AI algorithms can boost human creative thought. We employ a psychological task that demonstrates limits on human creativity, namely semantic feature generation: given a concept name, respondents must list as many of its features as possible. Human participants typically produce only a fraction of the features they know before getting "stuck." In experiments with humans and with a language AI (GPT-4) we contrast behavior in the standard task versus a variant in which participants can ask for algorithmically-generated hints. Algorithm choice is administered by a multi-armed bandit whose reward indicates whether the hint helped generating more features. Humans and the AI show similar benefits from hints, and remarkably, bandits learning from AI responses prefer the same prompting strategy as those learning from human behavior. The results suggest that strategies for boosting human creativity via computer interactions can be learned by bandits run on groups of simulated participants.},

(Science 369:1060--1062, 2020). Our multidisciplinary team of data scientists, statisticians, experts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and visual analytics had a unique role on the program to investigate accuracy, reproducibility, generalizability, and robustness of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) causal structure learning approaches applied to fully observed and sampled simulated data across virtual worlds. In addition, we analyzed the feasibility of using machine learning models to predict future social behavior with and without causal knowledge explicitly embedded. In this paper, we first present our causal modeling approach to discover the causal structure of four virtual worlds produced by the simulation teams---Urban Life, Financial Governance, Disaster and Geopolitical Conflict. Our approach adapts the state-of-the-art causal discovery (including ensemble models), machine learning, data analytics, and visualization techniques to allow a human-machine team to reverse-engineer the true causal relations from sampled and fully observed data. We next present our reproducibility analysis of two research methods team's performance using a range of causal discovery models applied to both sampled and fully observed data, and analyze their effectiveness and limitations. We further investigate the generalizability and robustness to sampling of the SOTA causal discovery approaches on additional simulated datasets with known ground truth. Our results reveal the limitations of existing causal modeling approaches when applied to large-scale, noisy, high-dimensional data with unobserved variables and unknown relationships between them. We show that the SOTA causal models explored in our experiments are not designed to take advantage from vasts amounts of data and have difficulty recovering ground truth when latent confounders are present; they do not generalize well across simulation scenarios and are not robust to sampling; they are vulnerable to data and modeling assumptions, and therefore, the results are hard to reproduce. Finally, when we outline lessons learned and provide recommendations to improve models for causal discovery and prediction of human social behavior from observational data, we highlight the importance of learning data to knowledge representations or transformations to improve causal discovery and describe the benefit of causal feature selection for predictive and prescriptive modeling.},

Using longitudinal head-mounted camera recordings from one child aged 6 to 25 months, we trained a relatively generic neural network on 61 hours of correlated visual-linguistic data streams, learning feature-based representations and cross-modal associations. Our model acquires many word-referent mappings present in the child's everyday experience, enables zero-shot generalization to new visual referents, and aligns its visual and linguistic conceptual systems.

(2016), that are trained on a large corpus of journal abstracts covering the period of 1980-- 2019. Several concepts showed evidence of broadening. ``Addiction'' moved from physiological dependency on a substance to include psychological dependency on gaming and the Internet. Similarly, ``harassment'' and ``trauma'' shifted towards more psychological meanings. On the other hand, ``bullying'' has transformed into a more victim-related concept and expanded to new areas such as workplaces.},

Simple participant behavioral data, such as the frequency and duration of information access, were recorded in real time for each participant.

The emergence of social norms fosters coordination among agents without any hard-coded rules, which is crucial for the large-scale deployment of autonomous vehicles (AVs) in an intelligent transportation system. This paper explores the application of large language models (LLMs) in understanding and modeling social norms in autonomous driving games. We introduce LLMs into autonomous driving games as intelligent agents who make decisions according to text prompts. These agents are referred to as LLM agents. Our framework involves LLM agents playing Markov games in a multi-agent system (MAS), allowing us to investigate the emergence of social norms among individual agents. We aim to identify social norms by designing prompts and utilizing LLMs on textual information related to the environment setup and the observations of LLM agents. Using the OpenAI Chat API powered by GPT-4.0, we conduct experiments to simulate interactions and evaluate the performance of LLM agents in two driving scenarios: unsignalized intersection and highway platoon. The results show that LLM agents can handle dynamically changing environments in Markov games, and social norms evolve among LLM agents in both scenarios. In the intersection game, LLM agents tend to adopt a conservative driving policy when facing a potential car crash. The advantage of LLM agents in games lies in their strong operability and analyzability, which facilitate experimental design.},

We developed a comprehensive theoretical framework for social dynamics and introduced two evaluation tasks: Inverse Reasoning (IR) and Inverse Inverse Planning (IIP). Our approach also encompassed a computational model based on recursive Bayesian inference, adept at elucidating diverse human behavioral patterns. Extensive experiments and detailed analyses revealed that humans surpassed the latest GPT models in overall performance, zero-shot learning, one-shot generalization, and adaptability to multi-modalities. Notably, GPT models demonstrated social intelligence only at the most basic order (order = 0), in stark contrast to human social intelligence (order {$>$}= 2). Further examination indicated a propensity of LLMs to rely on pattern recognition for shortcuts, casting doubt on their possession of authentic human-level social intelligence.

Focusing on two representative reasoning types, composition and comparison, we consistently find that transformers can learn implicit reasoning, but only through grokking, i.e., extended training far beyond overfitting. The levels of generalization also vary across reasoning types: when faced with out-of-distribution examples, transformers fail to systematically generalize for composition but succeed for comparison. We delve into the model's internals throughout training, conducting analytical experiments that reveal: 1) the mechanism behind grokking, such as the formation of the generalizing circuit and its relation to the relative efficiency of generalizing and memorizing circuits, and 2) the connection between systematicity and the configuration of the generalizing circuit. Our findings guide data and training setup to better induce implicit reasoning and suggest potential improvements to the transformer architecture, such as encouraging cross-layer knowledge sharing. Furthermore, we demonstrate that for a challenging reasoning task with a large search space, GPT-4-Turbo and Gemini-1.5-Pro based on non-parametric memory fail badly regardless of prompting styles or retrieval augmentation, while a fully grokked transformer can achieve near-perfect accuracy, showcasing the power of parametric memory for complex reasoning.},

Although LLM-generated annotations are more cost-effective and efficient to obtain, they are often erroneous for complex or domain-specific tasks and may introduce bias when compared to human annota- tions. Therefore, instead of completely replacing human annotators with LLMs, we need to leverage the strengths of both LLMs and humans to ensure the accuracy and reliability of annotations. This paper presents a multi-step human-LLM collaborative approach where (1) LLMs generate labels and provide explanations, (2) a ver- ifier assesses the quality of LLM-generated labels, and (3) human annotators re-annotate a subset of labels with lower verification scores. To facilitate human-LLM collaboration, we make use of LLM's ability to rationalize its decisions. LLM-generated explana- tions can provide additional information to the verifier model as well as help humans better understand LLM labels. We demonstrate that our verifier is able to identify potentially incorrect LLM labels for human re-annotation. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of presenting LLM labels and explanations on human re-annotation through crowdsourced studies.},

Traditionally, in all of these settings survey distributors are careful to find representative samples of the human population to ensure the validity of their results and understand potential demographic differences. This means in order to be a suitable replacement, LLMs will need to be able to capture the influence of positionality (i.e., relevance of social identities like gender and race). However, we show that there are two inherent limitations in the way current LLMs are trained that prevent this. We argue analytically for why LLMs are doomed to both misportray and flatten the representations of demographic groups, then empirically show this to be true on 4 LLMs through a series of human studies with 3200 participants across 16 demographic identities. We also discuss a third consideration about how identity prompts can essentialize identities. Throughout, we connect each of these limitations to a pernicious history that shows why each is harmful for marginalized demographic groups. Overall, we urge caution in use cases where LLMs are intended to replace human participants whose identities are relevant to the task at hand. At the same time, in cases where the goal is to supplement rather than replace (e.g., pilot studies), we provide empirically-better inference-time techniques to reduce, but not remove, these harms.},

First, a personalized driver model for lane-departure and lane-keeping behavior is established by combining the Gaussian mixture model and the hidden Markov model. Second, based on this model, we developed an online model-based prediction algorithm to predict the forthcoming vehicle trajectory and judge whether the driver will act a lane departure behavior or correction behavior. We also develop a warning strategy based on the model-based prediction algorithm that allows the lane-departure warning system to be acceptable for drivers according to the predicted trajectory. In addition, the naturalistic driving data of ten drivers were collected to train the personalized driver model and validate this approach. We compared the proposed method with a basic time-to-lane-crossing (TLC) method and a TLC-directional sequence of piecewise lateral slopes (TLC-DSPLS) method. Experimental results show that the proposed approach can reduce the false-warning rate to 3.13\% on average at 1-s prediction time.},

  abstract = {Building a human-like system that continuously interacts with complex environments---whether simulated digital worlds or human society---presents several key challenges. Central to this is enabling continuous, high-frequency interactions, where the interactions are termed experiences. We refer to this envisioned system as the LifeSpan Cognitive System (LSCS). A critical feature of LSCS is its ability to engage in incremental and rapid updates while retaining and accurately recalling past experiences. We identify two major challenges in achieving this: (1) Abstraction and Experience Merging, and (2) Long-term Retention with Accurate Recalling. These properties are essential for storing new experiences, organizing past experiences, and responding to the environment in ways that leverage relevant historical data. Unlike language models with continual learning, which typically rely on large corpora for fine-tuning and focus on improving performance within specific domains or tasks, LSCS must rapidly and incrementally update with new information from its environment at a high frequency. Existing technologies with the potential of solving the above two major challenges can be classified into four classes based on a conceptual metric called Storage Complexity, which measures the relative space required to store past experiences. Each of these four classes of technologies has its own strengths and limitations. Given that none of the existing technologies can achieve LSCS alone, we propose a novel paradigm for LSCS that integrates all four classes of technologies. The new paradigm operates through two core processes: Absorbing Experiences and Generating Responses.},

  abstract = {The extraordinary performance of large language models has not only reshaped the research landscape in the field of NLP but has also demonstrated its exceptional applicative potential in various domains. However, the potential of these models in mining relationships from graph data remains under-explored. Graph neural networks, as a popular research area in recent years, have numerous studies on relationship mining. Yet, current cutting-edge research in graph neural networks has not been effectively integrated with large language models, leading to limited efficiency and capability in graph relationship mining tasks. A primary challenge is the inability of LLMs to deeply exploit the edge information in graphs, which is critical for understanding complex node relationships. This gap limits the potential of LLMs to extract meaningful insights from graph structures, limiting their applicability in more complex graph-based analysis. We focus on how to utilize existing LLMs for mining and understanding relationships in graph data, applying these techniques to recommendation tasks. We propose an innovative framework that combines the strong contextual representation capabilities of LLMs with the relationship extraction and analysis functions of GNNs for mining relationships in graph data. Specifically, we design a new prompt construction framework that integrates relational information of graph data into natural language expressions, aiding LLMs in more intuitively grasping the connectivity information within graph data. Additionally, we introduce graph relationship understanding and analysis functions into LLMs to enhance their focus on connectivity information in graph data. Our evaluation on real-world datasets demonstrates the framework's ability to understand connectivity information in graph data.},

In our approach, we construct a layered MoA architecture wherein each layer comprises multiple LLM agents. Each agent takes all the outputs from agents in the previous layer as auxiliary information in generating its response. MoA models achieves state-of-art performance on AlpacaEval 2.0, MT-Bench and FLASK, surpassing GPT-4 Omni. For example, our MoA using only open-source LLMs is the leader of AlpacaEval 2.0 by a substantial gap, achieving a score of 65.1\% compared to 57.5\% by GPT-4 Omni.},

Generative AI methods can create designs, such as small-molecule drugs and proteins, by analysing diverse data modalities, including images and sequences. We discuss how these methods can help scientists throughout the scientific process and the central issues that remain despite such advances. Both developers and users of AI tools need a better understanding of when such approaches need improvement, and challenges posed by poor data quality and stewardship remain. These issues cut across scientific disciplines and require developing foundational algorithmic approaches that can contribute to scientific understanding or acquire it autonomously, making them critical areas of focus for AI innovation.},

To address these, our approach integrates task context and user perceptions into human-ChatGPT interactions through prompt engineering. We developed a ChatGPT-like platform integrated with supportive functions, including perception articulation, prompt suggestion, and conversation explanation. Our findings of a user study demonstrate that the supportive functions help users manage expectations, reduce cognitive loads, better refine prompts, and increase user engagement. This research enhances our comprehension of designing proactive and user-centric systems with LLMs. It offers insights into evaluating human-LLM interactions and emphasizes potential challenges for under served users.},

For example, in education, training novice educators with expert guidance is important for effectiveness but expensive, creating significant barriers to improving education quality at scale. This challenge disproportionately harms students from under-served communities, who stand to gain the most from high-quality education. We introduce Tutor CoPilot, a novel Human-AI approach that leverages a model of expert thinking to provide expert-like guidance to tutors as they tutor. This study is the first randomized controlled trial of a Human-AI system in live tutoring, involving 900 tutors and 1,800 K-12 students from historically under-served communities. Following a preregistered analysis plan, we find that students working with tutors that have access to Tutor CoPilot are 4 percentage points (p.p.) more likely to master topics (p{$<$}0.01). Notably, students of lower-rated tutors experienced the greatest benefit, improving mastery by 9 p.p. We find that Tutor CoPilot costs only \$20 per-tutor annually. We analyze 550,000+ messages using classifiers to identify pedagogical strategies, and find that tutors with access to Tutor CoPilot are more likely to use high-quality strategies to foster student understanding (e.g., asking guiding questions) and less likely to give away the answer to the student. Tutor interviews highlight how Tutor CoPilot's guidance helps tutors to respond to student needs, though they flag issues in Tutor CoPilot, such as generating suggestions that are not grade-level appropriate. Altogether, our study of Tutor CoPilot demonstrates how Human-AI systems can scale expertise in real-world domains, bridge gaps in skills and create a future where high-quality education is accessible to all students.},

Voyager interacts with GPT-4 via blackbox queries, which bypasses the need for model parameter fine-tuning.

  abstract = {Humans and other animals build up spatial knowledge of the environment on the basis of visual information and path integration. We compare three hypotheses about the geometry of this knowledge of navigation space: (a) `cognitive map' with metric Euclidean structure and a consistent coordinate system, (b) `topological graph' or network of paths between places, and (c) `labelled graph' incorporating local metric information about path lengths and junction angles. In two experiments, participants walked in a non-Euclidean environment, a virtual hedge maze containing two `wormholes' that visually rotated and teleported them between locations. During training, they learned the metric locations of eight target objects from a `home' location, which were visible individually. During testing, shorter wormhole routes to a target were preferred, and novel shortcuts were directional, contrary to the topological hypothesis. Shortcuts were strongly biased by the wormholes, with mean constant errors of 37{$^\circ$} and 41{$^\circ$} (45{$^\circ$} expected), revealing violations of the metric postulates in spatial knowledge. In addition, shortcuts to targets near wormholes shifted relative to flanking targets, revealing `rips' (86\% of cases), 'folds' (91\%), and ordinal reversals (66\%) in spatial knowledge. Moreover, participants were completely unaware of these geometric inconsistencies, reflecting a surprising insensitivity to Euclidean structure. The probability of the shortcut data under the Euclidean map model and labelled graph model indicated decisive support for the latter (BFGM{$>$}100). We conclude that knowledge of navigation space is best characterized by a labelled graph, in which local metric information is approximate, geometrically inconsistent, and not embedded in a common coordinate system. This class of `cognitive graph' models supports route finding, novel detours, and rough shortcuts, and has the potential to unify a range of data on spatial navigation.},

However, the learning environments and biases of current artificial learners and humans diverge in ways that weaken the impact of the evidence gleaned from learning simulations. Today's most effective neural language models are trained on roughly one thousand times the amount of linguistic data available to a typical child. To increase the relevance of learnability results from computational models, we need to train model learners without significant advantages over humans. If an appropriate model successfully acquires some target linguistic knowledge, it can provide a proof of concept that the target is learnable in a hypothesised human learning scenario. Plausible model learners will enable us to carry out experimental manipulations to make causal inferences about variables in the learning environment, and to rigorously test poverty-of-the-stimulus-style claims arguing for innate linguistic knowledge in humans on the basis of speculations about learnability. Comparable experiments will never be possible with human subjects due to practical and ethical considerations, making model learners an indispensable resource. So far, attempts to deprive current models of unfair advantages obtain sub-human results for key grammatical behaviours such as acceptability judgements. But before we can justifiably conclude that language learning requires more prior domain-specific knowledge than current models possess, we must first explore non-linguistic inputs in the form of multimodal stimuli and multi-agent interaction as ways to make our learners more efficient at learning from limited linguistic input.},

Here we performed a direct comparison between human reasoners and a large language model (the text-davinci-003 variant of Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT)-3) on a range of analogical tasks, including a non-visual matrix reasoning task based on the rule structure of Raven's Standard Progressive Matrices. We found that GPT-3 displayed a surprisingly strong capacity for abstract pattern induction, matching or even surpassing human capabilities in most settings; preliminary tests of GPT-4 indicated even better performance. Our results indicate that large language models such as GPT-3 have acquired an emergent ability to find zero-shot solutions to a broad range of analogy problems.},

Rousseau (1767) and Hegel (1807) were the early architects of this form of analysis, and it became so widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries that almost every early social theorist we now recognize as a contributor to modern social psychology held a similar view.

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) provide a new way to build chatbots by accepting natural language prompts. Yet, it is unclear how to design prompts to power chatbots to carry on naturalistic conversations while pursuing a given goal, such as collecting self-report data from users. We explore what design factors of prompts can help steer chatbots to talk naturally and collect data reliably. To this aim, we formulated four prompt designs with different structures and personas. Through an online study (N = 48) where participants conversed with chatbots driven by different designs of prompts, we assessed how prompt designs and conversation topics affected the conversation flows and users' perceptions of chatbots. Our chatbots covered 79\% of the desired information slots during conversations, and the designs of prompts and topics significantly influenced the conversation flows and the data collection performance. We discuss the opportunities and challenges of building chatbots with LLMs.},

  abstract = {The proliferation of large language models (LLMs) has revolutionized the capabilities of natural language interfaces (NLIs) for data analysis. LLMs can perform multi-step and complex reasoning to generate data insights based on users' analytic intents. However, these insights often entangle with an abundance of contexts in analytic conversations such as code, visualizations, and natural language explanations. This hinders efficient identification, verification, and interpretation of insights within the current chat-based interfaces of LLMs. In this paper, we first conduct a formative study with eight experienced data analysts to understand their general workflow and pain points during LLM-powered data analysis. Then, we propose an LLM-based multi-agent framework to automatically extract, associate, and organize insights along with the analysis process. Based on this, we introduce InsightLens, an interactive system that visualizes the intricate conversational contexts from multiple aspects to facilitate insight discovery and exploration. A user study with twelve data analysts demonstrates the effectiveness of InsightLens, showing that it significantly reduces users' manual and cognitive effort without disrupting their conversational data analysis workflow, leading to a more efficient analysis experience.},

  abstract = {Human-AI collaboration has become common, integrating highly complex AI systems into the workplace. Still, it is often ineffective; impaired perceptions -- such as low trust or limited understanding -- reduce compliance with recommendations provided by the AI system. Drawing from cognitive load theory, we examine two techniques of human-AI collaboration as potential remedies. In three experimental studies, we grant users decision control by empowering them to adjust the system's recommendations, and we offer explanations for the system's reasoning. We find decision control positively affects user perceptions of trust and understanding, and improves user compliance with system recommendations. Next, we isolate different effects of providing explanations that may help explain inconsistent findings in recent literature: while explanations help reenact the system's reasoning, they also increase task complexity. Further, the effectiveness of providing an explanation depends on the specific user's cognitive ability to handle complex tasks. In summary, our study shows that users benefit from enhanced decision control, while explanations -- unless appropriately designed for the specific user -- may even harm user perceptions and compliance. This work bears both theoretical and practical implications for the management of human-AI collaboration.},

  abstract = {The notion of common sense is invoked so frequently in contexts as diverse as everyday conversation, political debates, and evaluations of artificial intelligence that its meaning might be surmised to be unproblematic. Surprisingly, however, neither the intrinsic properties of common sense knowledge (what makes a claim commonsensical) nor the degree to which it is shared by people (its ``commonness'') have been characterized empirically. In this paper, we introduce an analytical framework for quantifying both these elements of common sense. First, we define the commonsensicality of individual claims and people in terms of the latter's propensity to agree on the former and their awareness of one another's agreement. Second, we formalize the commonness of common sense as a clique detection problem on a bipartite belief graph of people and claims, defining                                                                        pq                                                                  common sense as the fraction                                                   q                                               of claims shared by a fraction                                                   p                                               of people.

Psychometric attributes such as social perceptiveness influence individual common sense, but surprisingly demographic factors such as age or gender do not. Finally, we find that collective common sense is rare: At most, a small fraction                                                   p                                               of people agree on more than a small fraction                                                   q                                               of claims. Together, these results undercut universalistic beliefs about common sense and raise questions about its variability that are relevant both to human and artificial intelligence.},

RELAX explains representations by measuring similarities in the representation space between an input and masked out versions of itself, providing intuitive explanations and significantly outperforming the gradient-based baseline. We provide theoretical interpretations of RELAX and conduct a novel analysis of feature extractors trained using supervised and unsupervised learning, providing insights into different learning strategies. Finally, we illustrate the usability of RELAX in multi-view clustering and highlight that incorporating uncertainty can be essential for providing low-complexity explanations, taking a crucial step towards explaining representations.},

The market adoption of smart home technologies (SHTs) relies on prospective users perceiving clear benefits with acceptable levels of risk. This paper characterises the perceived benefits and risks of SHTs from multiple perspectives. A representative national survey of UK homeowners (n=1025) finds prospective users have positive perceptions of the multiple functionality of SHTs including energy management. Ceding autonomy and independence in the home for increased technological control are the main perceived risks. An additional survey of actual SHT users (n=42) participating in a smart home field trial identifies the key role of early adopters in lowering perceived SHT risks for the mass market. Content analysis of SHT marketing material (n=62) finds the SHT industry are insufficiently emphasising measures to build consumer confidence on data security and privacy. Policymakers can play an important role in mitigating perceived risks, and supporting the energy-management potential of a smart-home future. Policy measures to support SHT market development include design and operating standards, guidelines on data and privacy, quality control, and in situ research programmes. Policy experiences with domestic energy efficiency technologies and with national smart meter roll-outs offer useful precedents.},

  abstract = {Experimental design and computational modelling across the cognitive sciences often rely on measures of semantic similarity between concepts. Traditional measures of semantic similarity are typically derived from distance in taxonomic databases (e.g. WordNet), databases of participant-produced semantic features, or corpus-derived linguistic distributional similarity (e.g. CBOW), all of which are theoretically problematic in their lack of grounding in sensorimotor experience. We present a new measure of sensorimotor distance between concepts, based on multidimensional comparisons of their experiential strength across 11 perceptual and action-effector dimensions in the Lancaster Sensorimotor Norms. We demonstrate that, in modelling human similarity judgements, sensorimotor distance has comparable explanatory power to other measures of semantic similarity, explains variance in human judgements which is missed by other measures, and does so with the advantages of remaining both grounded and computationally efficient. Moreover, sensorimotor distance is equally effective for both concrete and abstract concepts. We further introduce a web-based tool (https://lancaster.ac.uk/psychology/smdistance) for easily calculating and visualising sensorimotor distance between words, featuring coverage of nearly 800 million word pairs.

We describe recent research on the Transaction Systems Model of Collective Intelligence (TSM-CI) that integrates literature from diverse areas of psychology to conceptualize the underpinnings of collective intelligence. The TSM-CI articulates the development and mutual adaptation of transactive memory, transactive attention, and transactive reasoning systems that together support the emergence and maintenance of collective intelligence. We also review related research on computational indicators of transactive-system functioning based on collaborative process behaviors that enable agent-based teammates to diagnose and potentially intervene to address developing issues. We conclude by discussing future directions in developing the TSM-CI to support research on developing collective human-machine intelligence and to identify ways to design technology to enhance it.},

Because Cognitive Architectures are famously developed for the purpose of modeling the internal mechanisms of human cognitive decision-making at a computational level, new investigations consider the goal of informing LLMs with the knowledge necessary for replicating such processes, e.g., guided perception, memory, goal-setting, and action. Previous approaches that use LLMs for grounded decision-making struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require slower, deliberate cognition over fast and intuitive inference---reporting issues related to the lack of sufficient grounding, as in hallucination. To resolve these challenges, we introduce LLM-ACTR, a novel neurosymbolic architecture that provides human-aligned and versatile decision-making by integrating the ACT-R Cognitive Architecture with LLMs. Our framework extracts and embeds knowledge of ACT-R's internal decision-making process as latent neural representations, injects this information into trainable LLM adapter layers, and fine-tunes the LLMs for downstream prediction. Our experiments on novel Design for Manufacturing tasks show both improved task performance as well as improved grounded decision-making capability of our approach, compared to LLM-only baselines that leverage chain-of-thought reasoning strategies.},

  abstract = {A large program of research has aimed to ground large-scale cultural phenomena in processes taking place within individual minds. For example, investigating whether individual agents equipped with the right social learning strategies can enable cumulative cultural evolution given long enough time horizons. However, this approach often omits the critical group-level processes that mediate between individual agents and multi-generational societies. Here, we argue that interacting groups are a necessary and explanatory level of analysis, linking individual and collective intelligence through two characteristic feedback loops. In the first loop, more sophisticated individual-level social learning mechanisms based on Theory of Mind facilitate group-level complementarity, allowing distributed knowledge to be compositionally recombined in groups; these group-level innovations, in turn, ease the cognitive load on individuals. In the second loop, societal-level processes of cumulative culture provide groups with new cognitive technologies, including shared language and conceptual abstractions, which set in motion new group-level processes to further coordinate, recombine, and innovate. Taken together, these cycles establish group-level interaction as a dual engine of intelligence, catalyzing both individual cognition and cumulative culture.},

Recent top-performing commercial LLMs, in particular, are also capable of citing sources to support their responses. In this paper, we ask: do the sources that LLMs generate actually support the claims that they make? To answer this, we propose three contributions. First, as expert medical annotations are an expensive and time-consuming bottleneck for scalable evaluation, we demonstrate that GPT-4 is highly accurate in validating source relevance, agreeing 88\% of the time with a panel of medical doctors. Second, we develop an end-to-end, automated pipeline called SourceCheckup and use it to evaluate five top-performing LLMs on a dataset of 1200 generated questions, totaling over 40K pairs of statements and sources. Interestingly, we find that between {$\sim$}50\% to 90\% of LLM responses are not fully supported by the sources they provide. We also evaluate GPT-4 with retrieval augmented generation (RAG) and find that, even still, around 30\% of individual statements are unsupported, while nearly half of its responses are not fully supported. Third, we open-source our curated dataset of medical questions and expert annotations for future evaluations. Given the rapid pace of LLM development and the potential harms of incorrect or outdated medical information, it is crucial to also understand and quantify their capability to produce relevant, trustworthy medical references.},

Are these skills general and transferable, or specialized to specific tasks seen during pretraining? To disentangle these effects, we propose an evaluation framework based on "counterfactual" task variants that deviate from the default assumptions underlying standard tasks. Across a suite of 11 tasks, we observe nontrivial performance on the counterfactual variants, but nevertheless find that performance substantially and consistently degrades compared to the default conditions. This suggests that while current LMs may possess abstract task-solving skills to an extent, they often also rely on narrow, non-transferable procedures for task-solving. These results motivate a more careful interpretation of language model performance that teases apart these aspects of behavior.},

Previous simulation results have found that the best performing groups exhibit an intermediate balance, yet it is still largely unknown how individuals collectively negotiate this balance. We use an immersive collective foraging experiment, implemented in the Minecraft game engine, facilitating unprecedented access to spatial trajectories and visual field data. The virtual environment imposes a limited field of view, creating a natural trade-off between allocating visual attention towards individual innovation or to look towards peers for social imitation. By analyzing foraging patterns, social interactions (visual and spatial), and social influence, we shine new light on how groups collectively adapt to the fluctuating demands of the environment through specialization and selective imitation, rather than homogeneity and indiscriminate copying of others.},

  abstract = {Humans are uniquely capable social learners. Our capacity to learn from others across short and long timescales is a driving force behind the success of our species. Yet there are seemingly maladaptive patterns of human social learning, characterized by both overreliance and underreliance on social information. Recent advances in animal research have incorporated rich visual and spatial dynamics to study social learning in ecological contexts, showing how simple mechanisms can give rise to intelligent group dynamics. However, similar techniques have yet to be translated into human research, which additionally requires integrating the sophistication of human individual and social learning mechanisms. Thus, it is still largely unknown how humans dynamically adapt social learning strategies to different environments and how group dynamics emerge under realistic conditions. Here, we use a collective foraging experiment in an immersive Minecraft environment to provide unique insights into how visual-spatial interactions give rise to adaptive, specialized, and selective social learning. Our analyses show how groups adapt to the demands of the environment through specialization of learning strategies rather than homogeneity and through the adaptive deployment of selective imitation rather than indiscriminate copying. We test these mechanisms using computational modeling, providing a deeper understanding of the cognitive mechanisms that dynamically influence social decision-making in ecological contexts. All results are compared against an asocial baseline, allowing us to specify specialization and selective attention as uniquely social phenomena, which provide the adaptive foundations of human social learning.},

We propose that this kind of representational alignment between machine learning (ML) models and humans can also support value alignment, allowing ML systems to conform to human values and societal norms. We focus on ethics as one aspect of value alignment and train ML agents using a variety of methods in a multi-armed bandit setting, where rewards reflect the moral acceptability of the chosen action. We use a synthetic experiment to demonstrate that agents' representational alignment with the environment bounds their learning performance. We then repeat this procedure in a realistic setting, using textual action descriptions and similarity judgments collected from humans and a variety of language models, to show that the results generalize and are model-agnostic when grounded in an ethically relevant context.},

  abstract = {Objective: The paper introduces a framework for the evaluation of the encoding of factual scientific knowledge, designed to streamline the manual evaluation process typically conducted by domain experts. Inferring over and extracting information from Large Language Models (LLMs) trained on a large corpus of scientific literature can potentially define a step change in biomedical discovery, reducing the barriers for accessing and integrating existing medical evidence. This work explores the potential of LLMs for dialoguing with biomedical background knowledge, using the context of antibiotic discovery. Methods: The framework involves three evaluation steps, each assessing different aspects sequentially: fluency, prompt alignment, semantic coherence, factual knowledge, and specificity of the generated responses. By splitting these tasks between non-experts and experts, the framework reduces the effort required from the latter. The work provides a systematic assessment on the ability of eleven state-of-the-art LLMs, including ChatGPT, GPT-4 and Llama 2, in two prompting-based tasks: chemical compound definition generation and chemical compound--fungus relation determination. Results: Although recent models have improved in fluency, factual accuracy is still low and models are biased towards over-represented entities. The ability of LLMs to serve as biomedical knowledge bases is questioned, and the need for additional systematic evaluation frameworks is highlighted. Conclusion: While LLMs are currently not fit for purpose to be used as biomedical factual knowledge bases in a zero-shot setting, there is a promising emerging property in the direction of factuality as the models become domain specialised, scale up in size and level of human feedback.},

In this paper, we focus on one of the most critical behaviors in human interactions, trust, and aim to investigate whether or not LLM agents can simulate human trust behaviors. We first find that LLM agents generally exhibit trust behaviors, referred to as agent trust, under the framework of Trust Games, which are widely recognized in behavioral economics. Then, we discover that LLM agents can have high behavioral alignment with humans regarding trust behaviors, indicating the feasibility to simulate human trust behaviors with LLM agents. In addition, we probe into the biases in agent trust and the differences in agent trust towards agents and humans. We also explore the intrinsic properties of agent trust under conditions including advanced reasoning strategies and external manipulations. We further offer important implications for various scenarios where trust is paramount. Our study represents a significant step in understanding the behaviors of LLM agents and the LLM-human analogy.},

However, due to a lack of professional medical knowledge, patients are easily misled by generated erroneous information from LLMs, which may result in serious medical problems. To address this issue, we focus on tuning the LLMs to be medical assistants who collaborate with more experienced doctors. We first conduct a two-stage survey by inspiration-feedback to gain a broad understanding of the real needs of doctors for medical assistants. Based on this, we construct a Chinese medical dataset called DoctorFLAN to support the entire workflow of doctors, which includes 92K Q\&A samples from 22 tasks and 27 specialists. Moreover, we evaluate LLMs in doctor-oriented scenarios by constructing the DoctorFLAN-test containing 550 single-turn Q\&A and DotaBench containing 74 multi-turn conversations. The evaluation results indicate that being a medical assistant still poses challenges for existing open-source models, but DoctorFLAN can help them significantly. It demonstrates that the doctor-oriented dataset and benchmarks we construct can complement existing patient-oriented work and better promote medical LLMs research.},

In this study, literature review and perspectives on the human behaviors and cognition (HBC) for ADVs toward human-autonomy (H-A) collaboration are proposed. First, the H-A collaboration basics and key factors are reviewed. Then, the HBC issues in driver behavior modeling and understanding are discussed. Specifically, two key factors are reviewed, which are human trust and situation awareness (SA). Next, HBC in two H-A collaboration-enabled vehicle control methods, namely, shared control and take-over control, are analyzed. It is shown that the human-centered collaboration strategy that integrates driver states will largely increase the acceptance of the ADVs. Then, the HBC issues in the design of human-machine-interface (HMI) for future autonomous and collaboration-enabled ADVs are discussed.

The increasing human-like capabilities of AI are also attracting attention in social science research, leading to various studies exploring the combination of these two fields. In this survey, we systematically categorize previous explorations in the combination of AI and social science into two directions that share common technical approaches but differ in their research objectives. The first direction is focused on AI for social science, where AI is utilized as a powerful tool to enhance various stages of social science research. While the second direction is the social science of AI, which examines AI agents as social entities with their human-like cognitive and linguistic capabilities. By conducting a thorough review, particularly on the substantial progress facilitated by recent advancements in large language models, this paper introduces a fresh perspective to reassess the relationship between AI and social science, provides a cohesive framework that allows researchers to understand the distinctions and connections between AI for social science and social science of AI, and also summarized state-of-art experiment simulation platforms to facilitate research in these two directions.

  abstract = {Despite vision-language models' (VLMs) remarkable capabilities as versatile visual assistants, two substantial challenges persist within the existing VLM frameworks: (1) lacking task diversity in pretraining and visual instruction tuning, and (2) annotation error and bias in GPT-4 synthesized instruction tuning data. Both challenges lead to issues such as poor generalizability, hallucination, and catastrophic forgetting. To address these challenges, we construct VISION-FLAN, the most diverse publicly available visual instruction tuning dataset to date, comprising 187 diverse tasks and 1,664,261 instances sourced from academic datasets, and each task is accompanied by an expert-written instruction. In addition, we propose a two-stage instruction tuning framework, in which VLMs are firstly finetuned on VISIONFLAN and further tuned on GPT-4 synthesized data. We find this two-stage tuning framework significantly outperforms the traditional single-stage visual instruction tuning framework and achieves the state-of-the-art performance across a wide range of multi-modal evaluation benchmarks. Finally, we conduct indepth analyses to understand visual instruction tuning and our findings reveal that: (1) GPT-4 synthesized data does not substantially enhance VLMs' capabilities but rather modulates the model's responses to human-preferred formats; (2) A minimal quantity (e.g., 1,000) of GPT4 synthesized data can effectively align VLM responses with human-preference; (3) Visual instruction tuning mainly helps large-language models (LLMs) to understand visual features.},

  abstract = {Transformer models, notably large language models (LLMs), have the remarkable ability to perform in-context learning (ICL) -- to perform new tasks when prompted with unseen input-output examples without any explicit model training. In this work, we study how effectively transformers can bridge between their pretraining data mixture, comprised of multiple distinct task families, to identify and learn new tasks in-context which are both inside and outside the pretraining distribution. Building on previous work, we investigate this question in a controlled setting, where we study transformer models trained on sequences of \$(x, f(x))\$ pairs rather than natural language. Our empirical results show transformers demonstrate near-optimal unsupervised model selection capabilities, in their ability to first in-context identify different task families and in-context learn within them when the task families are well-represented in their pretraining data. However when presented with tasks or functions which are out-of-domain of their pretraining data, we demonstrate various failure modes of transformers and degradation of their generalization for even simple extrapolation tasks. Together our results highlight that the impressive ICL abilities of high-capacity sequence models may be more closely tied to the coverage of their pretraining data mixtures than inductive biases that create fundamental generalization capabilities.},

  abstract = {{$<$}p{$>$}In this study, we proposed a novel chatbot interaction strategy based on the {$<$}italic{$>$}suggestive ending{$<$}/italic{$>$} of answers. This strategy is inspired by the cliffhanger ending narrative technique, which ends a story without specifying conclusions to spark readers' curiosity as to what will happen next and is often used in television series. Common chatbots provide relevant and comprehensive answers to users' questions. In contrast, chatbots with our proposed strategy end their answers with hints potentially interest-triggering users. The suggestive ending strategy aims to stimulate users' inquisition for critical decision-making, relating to a psychological phenomenon where humans are often urged to finish the uncompleted tasks they have initiated. We demonstrated the implication of our strategy by conducting an online user study involving 300 participants, where they used chatbots to perform three decision-making tasks. We adopted a between-subjects factorial experimental design and compared between the following UIs: (1) {$<$}italic{$>$}plain{$<$}/italic{$>$} chatbot---it provides a generated answer when participants issue a question; (2) {$<$}italic{$>$}expositive{$<$}/italic{$>$} chatbot---it provides a generated answer for a question, adding short summaries of a positive and negative person's opinion for the answer; (3) {$<$}italic{$>$}suggestive{$<$}/italic{$>$} chatbot---it provides a generated answer for a question, which ends with a suggestion of a positive and negative person for the answer. We found that users of the {$<$}italic{$>$}suggestive{$<$}/italic{$>$} chatbot were inclined to ask more questions to the bot, engage in prolonged decision-making and information-seeking actions, and formulate their opinions from various perspectives. These findings vary with the users' experience with {$<$}italic{$>$}plain{$<$}/italic{$>$} and {$<$}italic{$>$}expositive{$<$}/italic{$>$} chatbots.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

Recent studies have shown that LLMs can surpass humans in certain tasks, such as predicting the outcomes of neuroscience studies. What role does this leave for humans in the overall decision process? One possibility is that humans, despite performing worse than LLMs, can still add value when teamed with them. A human and machine team can surpass each individual teammate when team members' confidence is well-calibrated and team members diverge in which tasks they find difficult (i.e., calibration and diversity are needed). We simplified and extended a Bayesian approach to combining judgments using a logistic regression framework that integrates confidence-weighted judgments for any number of team members. Using this straightforward method, we demonstrated in a neuroscience forecasting task that, even when humans were inferior to LLMs, their combination with one or more LLMs consistently improved team performance. Our hope is that this simple and effective strategy for integrating the judgments of humans and machines will lead to productive collaborations.},

  abstract = {Large multimodal models (LMMs) extend large language models (LLMs) with multi-sensory skills, such as visual understanding, to achieve stronger generic intelligence. In this paper, we analyze the latest model, GPT-4V(ision), to deepen the understanding of LMMs. The analysis focuses on the intriguing tasks that GPT-4V can perform, containing test samples to probe the quality and genericity of GPT-4V's capabilities, its supported inputs and working modes, and the effective ways to prompt the model. In our approach to exploring GPT-4V, we curate and organize a collection of carefully designed qualitative samples spanning a variety of domains and tasks. Observations from these samples demonstrate that GPT-4V's unprecedented ability in processing arbitrarily interleaved multimodal inputs and the genericity of its capabilities together make GPT-4V a powerful multimodal generalist system. Furthermore, GPT-4V's unique capability of understanding visual markers drawn on input images can give rise to new human-computer interaction methods such as visual referring prompting. We conclude the report with in-depth discussions on the emerging application scenarios and the future research directions for GPT-4V-based systems. We hope that this preliminary exploration will inspire future research on the next-generation multimodal task formulation, new ways to exploit and enhance LMMs to solve real-world problems, and gaining better understanding of multimodal foundation models. Finally, we acknowledge that the model under our study is solely the product of OpenAI's innovative work, and they should be fully credited for its development.

  abstract = {The increasing prevalence of Cyber-Physical Systems and the Internet of Things (CPS-IoT) applications and Foundation Models are enabling new applications that leverage real-time control of the environment. For example, real-time control of Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems can reduce its usage when not needed for the comfort of human occupants, hence reducing energy consumption. Collecting realtime feedback on human preferences in such human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems, however, is difficult in practice. We propose the use of large language models (LLMs) to deal with the challenges of dynamic environments and difficult-to-obtain data in CPS optimization. In this paper, we present a case study that employs LLM agents to mimic the behaviors and thermal preferences of various population groups (e.g. young families, the elderly) in a shopping mall. The aggregated thermal preferences are integrated into an agent-in-the-loop based reinforcement learning algorithm AitL-RL, which employs the LLM as a dynamic simulation of the physical environment to learn how to balance between energy savings and occupant comfort. Our results show that LLMs are capable of simulating complex population movements within large open spaces. Besides, AitL-RLdemonstrates superior performance compared to the popular existing policy of set point control, suggesting that adaptive and personalized decision-making is critical for efficient optimization in CPS-IoT applications. Through this case study, we demonstrate the potential of integrating advanced Foundation Models like LLMs into CPS-IoT to enhance system adaptability and efficiency.

We observed that the choice of voting methods and the presentation order influenced LLM voting outcomes. We found that varying the persona can reduce some of these biases and enhance alignment with human choices. While the Chain-of-Thought approach did not improve prediction accuracy, it has potential for AI explainability in the voting process. We also identified a trade-off between preference diversity and alignment accuracy in LLMs, influenced by different temperature settings. Our findings indicate that LLMs may lead to less diverse collective outcomes and biased assumptions when used in voting scenarios, emphasizing the need for cautious integration of LLMs into democratic processes.},

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs' role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults' conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers' efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs' capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication.},

Intelligent Science Stations are mixed-reality systems that bridge the physical and virtual worlds to improve children's inquiry-based STEM learning. Automated reactive guidance is made possible by a specialized AI computer vision algorithm, providing personalized interactive feedback to children as they experiment and make discoveries in their physical environment. We report on a randomized controlled experiment where we compare learning outcomes of children interacting with the Intelligent Science Station that has task-loop adaptivity incorporated, compared to another version that provides tasks randomly without adaptivity. Our results show that adaptivity using Bayesian Knowledge Tracing in the context of a mixed-reality system leads to better learning of scientific principles, without sacrificing enjoyment.

Our results showed that most of the included models presented reasoning errors akin to those frequently ascribed to error-prone, heuristic-based human reasoning. Notwithstanding this superficial similarity, an in-depth comparison between humans and LLMs indicated important differences with human-like reasoning, with models' limitations disappearing almost entirely in more recent LLMs' releases. Moreover, we show that while it is possible to devise strategies to induce better performance, humans and machines are not equally responsive to the same prompting schemes. We conclude by discussing the epistemological implications and challenges of comparing human and machine behavior for both artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence (AI) technologies have been increasingly integrated into human workflows. For example, the usage of AI-based decision aids in human decision-making processes has resulted in a new paradigm of AI-assisted decision making---that is, the AI-based decision aid provides a decision recommendation to the human decision makers, while humans make the final decision. The increasing prevalence of human-AI collaborative decision making highlights the need to understand how humans engage with the AI-based decision aid in these decision-making processes, and how to promote the effectiveness of the human-AI team in decision making. In this talk, I'll discuss a few examples illustrating that when AI is used to assist humans---both an individual decision maker or a group of decision makers---in decision making, people's engagement with the AI assistance is largely subject to their heuristics and biases, rather than careful deliberation of the respective strengths and limitations of AI and themselves. I'll then describe how to enhance AI-assisted decision making by accounting for human engagement behavior in the designs of AI-based decision aids. For example, AI recommendations can be presented to decision makers in a way that promotes their appropriate trust and reliance on AI by leveraging or mitigating human biases, informed by the analysis of human competence in decision making. Alternatively, AI-assisted decision making can be improved by developing AI models that can anticipate and adapt to the engagement behavior of human decision makers.},

These intelligent home assistant frameworks, such as those based on high-performance LLMs like GPT-4, have greatly expanded their functional range and application scenarios by computing on the cloud, enriching user experience and diversification. In order to optimize the privacy and economy of data processing while maintaining the powerful functions of LLMs, we propose Harmony, a smart home assistant framework that uses a locally deployable small-scale LLM. Based on Llama3-8b, an open LLM that can be easily deployed on a consumer-grade PC, Harmony does not send any data to the internet during operation, ensuring local computation and privacy secured. Harmony based on Llama3-8b achieved competitive performance on our benchmark tests with the framework used in related work with GPT-4. In addition to solving the issues mentioned above, Harmony can also take actions according to the user and home status, even if the user does not issue a command. For example, when the user wants to wake up later than normal on the weekend, Harmony would open the curtains only when the user gets up or prepare the room when the user comes home without requiring user commands.},

A "visual analogy" is an abstract rule inferred from one image and applied to another. While benchmarks exist for testing visual reasoning in LMMs, they require advanced skills and omit basic visual analogies that even young children can make. Inspired by developmental psychology, we propose a new benchmark of 1,400 visual transformations of everyday objects to test LMMs on visual analogical reasoning and compare them to children and adults. We structure the evaluation into three stages: identifying what changed (e.g., color, number, etc.), how it changed (e.g., added one object), and applying the rule to new scenarios. Our findings show that while models like GPT-4V, LLaVA-1.5, and MANTIS identify the "what" effectively, they struggle with quantifying the "how" and extrapolating this rule to new objects. In contrast, children and adults exhibit much stronger analogical reasoning at all three stages. Additionally, the strongest tested model, GPT-4V, performs better in tasks involving simple visual attributes like color and size, correlating with quicker human adult response times. Conversely, more complex tasks such as number, rotation, and reflection, which necessitate extensive cognitive processing and understanding of the 3D physical world, present more significant challenges. Altogether, these findings highlight the limitations of training models on data that primarily consists of 2D images and text.},

As more people interact with these systems, improving our understanding of these black box models is crucial, especially regarding their understanding of human psychological aspects. In this work, we investigate their emotion perception through the lens of appraisal and coping theory using the Stress and Coping Process Questionaire (SCPQ). SCPQ is a validated clinical instrument consisting of multiple stories that evolve over time and differ in key appraisal variables such as controllability and changeability. We applied SCPQ to three recent LLMs from OpenAI, davinci-003, ChatGPT, and GPT-4 and compared the results with predictions from the appraisal theory and human data. The results show that LLMs' responses are similar to humans in terms of dynamics of appraisal and coping, but their responses did not differ along key appraisal dimensions as predicted by the theory and data. The magnitude of their responses is also quite different from humans in several variables. We also found that GPTs can be quite sensitive to instruction and how questions are asked. This work adds to the growing literature evaluating the psychological aspects of LLMs and helps enrich our understanding of the current models.},

In this work, we investigate how LLM embeddings and attention representations change following in-context-learning, and how these changes mediate improvement in behavior. We employ neuroscience-inspired techniques such as representational similarity analysis (RSA) and propose novel methods for parameterized probing and measuring ratio of attention to relevant vs. irrelevant information in Llama-2 70B and Vicuna 13B. We designed two tasks with a priori relationships among their conditions: linear regression and reading comprehension. We formed hypotheses about expected similarities in task representations and measured hypothesis alignment of LLM representations before and after ICL as well as changes in attention. Our analyses revealed a meaningful correlation between improvements in behavior after ICL and changes in both embeddings and attention weights across LLM layers. This empirical framework empowers a nuanced understanding of how latent representations shape LLM behavior, offering valuable tools and insights for future research and practical applications.},

The former include rule-based, geometric or optimization-based models, and the latter are mainly comprised of deep learning approaches. In this paper, we propose a new method combining both methodologies based on a new Neural Differential Equation model. Our new model (Neural Social Physics or NSP) is a deep neural network within which we use an explicit physics model with learnable parameters. The explicit physics model serves as a strong inductive bias in modeling pedestrian behaviors, while the rest of the network provides a strong data-fitting capability in terms of system parameter estimation and dynamics stochasticity modeling. We compare NSP with 15 recent deep learning methods on 6 datasets and improve the state-of-the-art performance by 5.56\%-70\%. Besides, we show that NSP has better generalizability in predicting plausible trajectories in drastically different scenarios where the density is 2-5 times as high as the testing data. Finally, we show that the physics model in NSP can provide plausible explanations for pedestrian behaviors, as opposed to black-box deep learning.

Their prowess in integrating extensive web knowledge has fueled interest in developing LLM autonomous agents. While LLMs are efficient in decoding human instructions and deriving solutions by holistically processing historical inputs, transitioning to purpose-driven agents requires a supplementary rational architecture to process multi-source information, establish reasoning chains, and prioritize critical tasks. Addressing this, we introduce {\textbackslash}textsc\{FinMe\}, a novel LLM-based agent framework devised for financial decision-making, encompassing three core modules: Profiling, to outline the agent's characteristics; Memory, with layered processing, to aid the agent in assimilating realistic hierarchical financial data; and Decision-making, to convert insights gained from memories into investment decisions. Notably, {\textbackslash}textsc\{FinMe\}'s memory module aligns closely with the cognitive structure of human traders, offering robust interpretability and real-time tuning. Its adjustable cognitive span allows for the retention of critical information beyond human perceptual limits, thereby enhancing trading outcomes. This framework enables the agent to self-evolve its professional knowledge, react agilely to new investment cues, and continuously refine trading decisions in the volatile financial environment. We first compare {\textbackslash}textsc\{FinMe\} with various algorithmic agents on a scalable real-world financial dataset, underscoring its leading trading performance in stocks and funds. We then fine-tuned the agent's perceptual spans to achieve a significant trading performance. Collectively, {\textbackslash}textsc\{FinMe\} presents a cutting-edge LLM agent framework for automated trading, boosting cumulative investment returns.},

  abstract = {With LLMs shifting their role from statistical modeling of language to serving as general-purpose AI agents, how should LLM evaluations change? Arguably, a key ability of an AI agent is to flexibly combine, as needed, the basic skills it has learned. The capability to combine skills plays an important role in (human) pedagogy and also in a paper on emergence phenomena (Arora \& Goyal, 2023). This work introduces Skill-Mix, a new evaluation to measure ability to combine skills. Using a list of \$N\$ skills the evaluator repeatedly picks random subsets of \$k\$ skills and asks the LLM to produce text combining that subset of skills. Since the number of subsets grows like \$N{\textasciicircum}k\$, for even modest \$k\$ this evaluation will, with high probability, require the LLM to produce text significantly different from any text in the training set. The paper develops a methodology for (a) designing and administering such an evaluation, and (b) automatic grading (plus spot-checking by humans) of the results using GPT-4 as well as the open LLaMA-2 70B model. Administering a version of to popular chatbots gave results that, while generally in line with prior expectations, contained surprises. Sizeable differences exist among model capabilities that are not captured by their ranking on popular LLM leaderboards ("cramming for the leaderboard"). Furthermore, simple probability calculations indicate that GPT-4's reasonable performance on \$k=5\$ is suggestive of going beyond "stochastic parrot" behavior (Bender et al., 2021), i.e., it combines skills in ways that it had not seen during training. We sketch how the methodology can lead to a Skill-Mix based eco-system of open evaluations for AI capabilities of future models.},

This study documents the development of large language models that accept as input a climate myth and produce a debunking that adheres to the fact-myth-fallacy-fact (``truth sandwich'') structure, by incorporating contrarian claim classification and fallacy detection into an LLM prompting framework. We combine open (Mixtral, Palm2) and proprietary (GPT-4) LLMs with prompting strategies of varying complexity. Experiments reveal promising performance of GPT-4 and Mixtral if combined with structured prompts. We identify specific challenges of debunking generation and human evaluation, and map out avenues for future work.

  abstract = {Film festivals are a key component in the global film industry in terms of trendsetting, publicity, trade, and collaboration. We present an unprecedented analysis of the international film festival circuit, which has so far remained relatively understudied quantitatively, partly due to the limited availability of suitable data sets. We use large-scale data from the Cinando platform of the Cannes Film Market, widely used by industry professionals. We explicitly model festival events as a global network connected by shared films and quantify festivals as aggregates of the metadata of their showcased films. Importantly, we argue against using simple count distributions for discrete labels such as language or production country, as such categories are typically not equidistant. Rather, we propose embedding them in continuous latent vector spaces. We demonstrate how these ``festival embeddings'' provide insight into changes in programmed content over time, predict festival connections, and can be used to measure diversity in film festival programming across various cultural, social, and geographical variables---which all constitute an aspect of public value creation by film festivals. Our results provide a novel mapping of the film festival circuit between 2009--2021 (616 festivals, 31,989 unique films), highlighting festival types that occupy specific niches, diverse series, and those that evolve over time. We also discuss how these quantitative findings fit into media studies and research on public value creation by cultural industries. With festivals occupying a central position in the film industry, investigations into the data they generate hold opportunities for researchers to better understand industry dynamics and cultural impact, and for organizers, policymakers, and industry actors to make more informed, data-driven decisions. We hope our proposed methodological approach to festival data paves way for more comprehensive film festival studies and large-scale quantitative cultural event analytics in general.},

AI's contribution to technology can come from multiple approaches that require access to large training data sets and clear performance evaluation criteria, ranging from pattern recognition and classification to generative models. Yet, AI has contributed less to fundamental science in part because large data sets of high-quality data for scientific practice and model discovery are more difficult to access. Generative AI, in general, and Large Language Models in particular, may represent an opportunity to augment and accelerate the scientific discovery of fundamental deep science with quantitative models. Here we explore and investigate aspects of an AI-driven, automated, closed-loop approach to scientific discovery, including self-driven hypothesis generation and open-ended autonomous exploration of the hypothesis space. Integrating AI-driven automation into the practice of science would mitigate current problems, including the replication of findings, systematic production of data, and ultimately democratisation of the scientific process. Realising these possibilities requires a vision for augmented AI coupled with a diversity of AI approaches able to deal with fundamental aspects of causality analysis and model discovery while enabling unbiased search across the space of putative explanations. These advances hold the promise to unleash AI's potential for searching and discovering the fundamental structure of our world beyond what human scientists have been able to achieve. Such a vision would push the boundaries of new fundamental science rather than automatize current workflows and instead open doors for technological innovation to tackle some of the greatest challenges facing humanity today.},

Current models of decision making in drivers provide little insight into the underlying cognitive processes. On the other hand, laboratory studies of abstract, highly controlled tasks point towards noisy evidence accumulation as a key mechanism governing decision making. However, it is unclear whether the cognitive processes implicated in these tasks are as paramount to decisions that are ingrained in more complex behaviors, such as driving.ResultsThe drivers? probability of accepting the available gap increased with the size of the gap; importantly, response time increased with time gap but not distance gap. The generalized drift-diffusion model explained the observed decision outcomes and response time distributions, as well as substantial individual differences in those. Through cross-validation, we demonstrate that the model not only explains the data, but also generalizes to out-of-sample conditions.ConclusionOur results suggest that dynamic evidence accumulation is an essential mechanism underlying left-turn gap acceptance decisions in human drivers, and exemplify how simple cognitive process models can help to understand human behavior in complex real-world tasks.ApplicationPotential applications of our results include real-time prediction of human behavior by automated vehicles and simulating realistic human-like behaviors in virtual environments for automated vehicles.},

To do this, we use a mixed-methods approach comprising of (i) an online survey with 220 participants and (ii) semi-structured interviews with 12 participants. Our results show that (i) the most common types of deceptive information encountered were over-simplifications and outdated information; (ii) humans' perceptions of trust and `worthiness' of talking to ChatGPT are impacted by `banal' deceptive behaviour; (iii) the perceived responsibility for deception is influenced by education level and the frequency of deceptive information; and (iv) users become more cautious after encountering deceptive information, but they come to trust the technology more when they identify advantages of using it. Our findings contribute to the understanding of human-AI interaction dynamics in the context of Deceptive AI Ecosystems, and highlight the importance of user-centric approaches to mitigating the potential harms of deceptive AI technologies.},

Compared with traditional unsupervised methods that builds upon ``small'' embedders, CLUSTERLLM exhibits two intriguing advantages: (1) it enjoys the emergent capability of LLM even if its embeddings are inaccessible; and (2) it understands the user's preference on clustering through textual instruction and/or a few annotated data. First, we prompt ChatGPT for insights on clustering perspective by constructing hard triplet questions {$<$}does A better correspond to B than C{$>$}, where A, B and C are similar data points that belong to different clusters according to small embedder. We empirically show that this strategy is both effective for fine-tuning small embedder and cost-efficient to query ChatGPT. Second, we prompt ChatGPT for helps on clustering granularity by carefully designed pairwise questions {$<$}do A and B belong to the same category{$>$}, and tune the granularity from cluster hierarchies that is the most consistent with the ChatGPT answers. Extensive experiments on 14 datasets show that CLUSTERLLM consistently improves clustering quality, at an average cost of {$\sim\$$}0.61 per dataset.

Language models trained on large human-generated corpus encode not only a significant amount of human knowledge, but also the human stereotype. As more and more downstream tasks have integrated language models as part of the pipeline, it is necessary to understand the internal stereotypical representation in order to design the methods for mitigating the negative effects. In this paper, we use counterexamples to examine the internal stereotypical knowledge in pre-trained language models (PLMs) that can lead to stereotypical preference. We mainly focus on gender stereotypes, but the method can be extended to other types of stereotype. We evaluate 7 PLMs on 9 types of cloze-style prompt with different information and base knowledge. The results indicate that PLMs show a certain amount of robustness against unrelated information and preference of shallow linguistic cues, such as word position and syntactic structure, but a lack of interpreting information by meaning. Such findings shed light on how to interact with PLMs in a neutral approach for both finetuning and evaluation.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited great potential in fault diagnosis of heating, ventilation, and air conditioning systems. However, the fault diagnosis accuracy of LLMs is still unsatisfactory, due to the lack of effective diagnosis accuracy enhancement methods for LLMs. To fill this gap, this study proposes a LLM fine-tuning method supervised by data with fault and fault-free labels to enhance the fault diagnosis accuracy of LLMs. This method designs a LLM self-correction strategy to automatically generate a fine-tuning dataset based on the labeled data. The generated fine-tuning dataset is applied to fine-tune a LLM. Moreover, a data augmentation-based approach is put forward to adaptively update the fine-tuning dataset for iteratively developing a high-performance fine-tuned LLM. The proposed method is utilized to fine-tune the GPT-3.5 model using the air handling unit (AHU) fault dataset from the RP-1312 project. The results show that the diagnosis accuracy of the GPT-3.5 model is increased from 29.5~\% to 100.0~\% after model fine-tuning. Compared with the GPT-4 model, the fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model achieves a 31.1~\% higher average diagnosis accuracy. The fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model is also applied to diagnose faults in two AHUs from another open-source dataset to verify the generalization ability of this model. The two AHUs have different system structures and sensor configurations compared to the AHU in the RP-1312 dataset, and this dataset is not utilized to fine-tune the GPT-3.5 model. The average diagnosis accuracy of the GPT-3.5 model is increased from 46.0~\% to 99.1~\% and from 38.8~\% to 98.9~\% for the faults in the two AHUs, respectively, after model fine-tuning. Furthermore, the proposed method is verified using two fault datasets from a variable air volume box and a chiller plant system. After fine-tuning the GPT-3.5 model using the two datasets, the average diagnosis accuracy of this model is increased from 33.0~\% to 98.3~\% for variable air volume box faults and from 36.0~\% to 99.1~\% for chiller plant system faults. This study provides an effective solution to the development of domain-specific LLMs for this domain.},

This paper probes the collaboration mechanisms among contemporary NLP systems by melding practical experiments with theoretical insights. We fabricate four unique `societies' comprised of LLM agents, where each agent is characterized by a specific `trait' (easy-going or overconfident) and engages in collaboration with a distinct `thinking pattern' (debate or reflection). Through evaluating these multi-agent societies on three benchmark datasets, we discern that certain collaborative strategies not only outshine previous top-tier approaches but also optimize efficiency (using fewer API tokens). Moreover, our results further illustrate that LLM agents manifest humanlike social behaviors, such as conformity and consensus reaching, mirroring foundational social psychology theories. In conclusion, we integrate insights from social psychology to contextualize the collaboration of LLM agents, inspiring further investigations into the collaboration mechanism for LLMs. We have shared our code and datasets1, hoping to catalyze further research in this promising avenue.},

Our framework is designed to investigate and quantify the presence of gender stereotypes in LLMs' behavior via multi-round question answering. Inspired by prior works, we construct a dataset by leveraging a standard occupation classification knowledge base released by authoritative agencies. We tested three LLMs (RoBERTa-large, GPT-3.5-turbo, and Llama2-70b-chat) and found that all models exhibit gender stereotypes analogous to human biases, but with different preferences.

Predicting human travel is significant in aiding various transportation and urban management tasks, such as taxi dispatch and urban planning.

Nowadays, with the advent of large language models (LLMs), many researchers have combined these models with previous techniques or applied LLMs to directly predict future traffic information and human travel behaviors. However, there is a lack of comprehensive studies on how LLMs can contribute to this field. This survey explores existing approaches using LLMs for mobility forecasting problems. We provide a literature review concerning the forecasting applications within transportation systems, elucidating how researchers utilize LLMs, showcasing recent state-of-the-art advancements, and identifying the challenges that must be overcome to fully leverage LLMs in this domain.},

This paper addresses this research gap by integrating noisy-label learning, multi-rater learning, and human-AI collaboration with new benchmarks and the innovative Learning to Complement with Multiple Humans (LECOMH) approach. LECOMH optimises the level of human collaboration during testing, aiming to optimise classification accuracy while minimising collaboration costs that vary from 0 to M, where M is the maximum number of human collaborators. We quantitatively compare LECOMH with leading human-AI collaboration methods using our proposed benchmarks. LECOMH consistently outperforms the competition, with accuracy improving as collaboration costs increase.

Each LLM offering has different inference accuracy, monetary cost, and latency, and their accuracy further depends on the exact wording of the question (i.e., the specific prompt). At the same time, users often have a limit on monetary budget and latency to answer all their questions, and they do not know which LLMs to choose for each question to meet their accuracy and long term budget requirements. To navigate this rich design space, we propose TREACLE (Thrifty Reasoning via Context-Aware LLM and Prompt Selection), a reinforcement learning policy that jointly selects the model and prompting scheme while respecting the user's monetary cost and latency constraints. TREACLE uses the problem context, including question text embeddings (reflecting the type or difficulty of a query) and the response history (reflecting the consistency of previous responses) to make smart decisions. Our evaluations on standard reasoning datasets (GSM8K, CSQA, and LLC ) with various LLMs and prompts show that TREACLE enables cost savings of up to 85\% compared to baselines, while maintaining high accuracy. Importantly, it provides the user with the ability to gracefully trade off accuracy for cost.},

Even though AI's communication serves as an essential part of facilitating team coordination and shaping team outcomes, the impact of AI's communication modality on human-AI teamwork is still understudied. Using a mixed-design experiment and follow-up group interviews with 100 participants, we investigate the impact of AI's communication modality, one of AI's most essential communication characteristics, on team coordination and team outcomes in two different human-AI team compositions, human-human-AI teams, and human-AI-AI teams. Our findings highlight the trade-offs between AI's verbal communication and visual communication, which inspire two design recommendations on how to apply AI's verbal and visual communication to support human-AI coordination effectively. Our study generates an initial understanding of the role that AI's communication will have in ensuring team effectiveness in human-AI teams in the CSCW/HCI field.},

While spatial language understanding and reasoning by vision-language models (VLMs) have gained increasing attention, potential ambiguities in these models are still under-explored. To address this issue, we present the COnsistent Multilingual Frame Of Reference Test (COMFORT), an evaluation protocol to systematically assess the spatial reasoning capabilities of VLMs. We evaluate nine state-of-the-art VLMs using COMFORT. Despite showing some alignment with English conventions in resolving ambiguities, our experiments reveal significant shortcomings of VLMs: notably, the models (1) exhibit poor robustness and consistency, (2) lack the flexibility to accommodate multiple FoRs, and (3) fail to adhere to language-specific or culture-specific conventions in cross-lingual tests, as English tends to dominate other languages. With a growing effort to align vision-language models with human cognitive intuitions, we call for more attention to the ambiguous nature and cross-cultural diversity of spatial reasoning.},

However, recent research shows that the effectiveness of explanations depends on numerous factors, leading to mixed results, with many studies finding no effect or even an increase in overreliance, while explanations do improve appropriate reliance in other studies. We consider the factor of decision difficulty to better understand when feature-based explanations can mitigate overreliance. To this end, we conducted an online experiment ({$N$} = 200) with carefully selected task instances that cover a wide range of difficulties. We found that explanations reduce overreliance for easy decisions, but that this effect vanishes with increasing decision difficulty. For the most difficult decisions, explanations might even increase overreliance. Our results imply that explanations of the model's inner workings are only helpful for a limited set of decision tasks where users easily know the answer themselves.},

  abstract = {Automated vehicles (AVs) must be thoroughly evaluated before their release and deployment. A widely used evaluation approach is the Naturalistic-Field Operational Test (N-FOT), which tests prototype vehicles directly on the public roads. Due to the low exposure to safety-critical scenarios, N-FOTs are time consuming and expensive to conduct. In this paper, we propose an accelerated evaluation approach for AVs. The results can be used to generate motions of the other primary vehicles to accelerate the verification of AVs in simulations and controlled experiments. Frontal collision due to unsafe cut-ins is the target crash type of this paper. Human-controlled vehicles making unsafe lane changes are modeled as the primary disturbance to AVs based on data collected by the University of Michigan Safety Pilot Model Deployment Program. The cut-in scenarios are generated based on skewed statistics of collected human driver behaviors, which generate risky testing scenarios while preserving the statistical information so that the safety benefits of AVs in nonaccelerated cases can be accurately estimated. The cross-entropy method is used to recursively search for the optimal skewing parameters. The frequencies of the occurrences of conflicts, crashes, and injuries are estimated for a modeled AV, and the achieved accelerated rate is around 2000 to 20 000. In other words, in the accelerated simulations, driving for 1000 miles will expose the AV with challenging scenarios that will take about 2 to 20 million miles of real-world driving to encounter. This technique thus has the potential to greatly reduce the development and validation time for AVs.},

In the present paper, we report three studies that investigated the effects of map complexity and crowd movement on wayfinding time, accuracy and hesitation using both online and laboratory-based networked virtual reality (VR) platforms. In the online study, we found that simple map designs led to shorter decision times and higher accuracy compared to complex map designs. In the networked VR set-up, we found that co-present participants made very few errors. In the final VR study, we replayed the traces of participants' avatars from the second study so that they indicated a different direction than the maps. In this scenario, we found an interaction between map design and crowd movement in terms of decision time and the distributions of locations at which participants hesitated. Together, these findings can help the designers of maps for public spaces account for the movements of real crowds.},

The question of whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can possess emotions remains elusive, chiefly due to the absence of an operationalized consensus on what constitutes 'emotion' within AI. Adopting a pragmatic approach, this study investigated the response patterns of AI chatbots---specifically, large language models (LLMs)---to various emotional primes. We engaged AI chatbots as one would human participants, presenting scenarios designed to elicit positive, negative, or neutral emotional states. Multiple accounts of OpenAI's ChatGPT Plus were then tasked with responding to inquiries concerning investment decisions and prosocial behaviors. Our analysis revealed that ChatGPT-4 bots, when primed with positive, negative, or neutral emotions, exhibited distinct response patterns in both risk-taking and prosocial decisions, a phenomenon less evident in the ChatGPT-3.5 iterations. This observation suggests an enhanced capacity for modulating responses based on emotional cues in more advanced LLMs. While these findings do not suggest the presence of emotions in AI, they underline the feasibility of swaying AI responses by leveraging emotional indicators.},

In this article, we provide a comprehensive overview of brain-inspired AI from the perspective of AGI. We begin with the current progress in brain-inspired AI and its extensive connection with AGI. We then cover the important characteristics for both human intelligence and AGI (e.g., scaling, multimodality, and reasoning). We discuss important technologies toward achieving AGI in current AI systems, such as in-context learning and prompt tuning. We also investigate the evolution of AGI systems from both algorithmic and infrastructural perspectives. Finally, we explore the limitations and future of AGI.},

To bridge this gap, we introduce WildHallucinations, a benchmark that evaluates factuality. It does so by prompting LLMs to generate information about entities mined from user-chatbot conversations in the wild. These generations are then automatically fact-checked against a systematically curated knowledge source collected from web search. Notably, half of these real-world entities do not have associated Wikipedia pages. We evaluate 118,785 generations from 15 LLMs on 7,919 entities. We find that LLMs consistently hallucinate more on entities without Wikipedia pages and exhibit varying hallucination rates across different domains. Finally, given the same base models, adding a retrieval component only slightly reduces hallucinations but does not eliminate hallucinations.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) have drastically reshaped our interactions with artificial intelligence (AI) systems, showcasing impressive performance across an extensive array of tasks. Despite this, a notable hindrance remains---the deficiency of a long-term memory mechanism within these models. This shortfall becomes increasingly evident in situations demanding sustained interaction, such as personal companion systems, psychological counseling, and secretarial assistance. Recognizing the necessity for long-term memory, we propose MemoryBank, a novel memory mechanism tailored for LLMs. MemoryBank enables the models to summon relevant memories, continually evolve through continuous memory updates, comprehend, and adapt to a user's personality over time by synthesizing information from previous interactions. To mimic anthropomorphic behaviors and selectively preserve memory, MemoryBank incorporates a memory updating mechanism, inspired by the Ebbinghaus Forgetting Curve theory. This mechanism permits the AI to forget and reinforce memory based on time elapsed and the relative significance of the memory, thereby offering a more human-like memory mechanism and enriched user experience. MemoryBank is versatile in accommodating both closed-source models like ChatGPT and open-source models such as ChatGLM. To validate MemoryBank's effectiveness, we exemplify its application through the creation of an LLM-based chatbot named SiliconFriend in a long-term AI Companion scenario. Further tuned with psychological dialog data, SiliconFriend displays heightened empathy and discernment in its interactions. Experiment involves both qualitative analysis with realworld user dialogs and quantitative analysis with simulated dialogs. In the latter, ChatGPT acts as multiple users with diverse characteristics and generates long-term dialog contexts covering a wide array of topics. The results of our analysis reveal that SiliconFriend, equipped with MemoryBank, exhibits a strong capability for long-term companionship as it can provide emphatic response, recall relevant memories and understand user personality.},

Current research has not thoroughly assessed potential biases in the sociodemographic population represented within the language model's framework. Additionally, the subjective worlds of LLMs often show inconsistencies in how closely their responses match those of groups of human respondents. In this paper, we used ChatGPT-3.5 to simulate the sampling process and generated six socioeconomic characteristics from the 2020 US population. We also analyzed responses to questions about income inequality and gender roles to explore GPT's subjective attitudes. By using repeated random sampling, we created a sampling distribution to identify the parameters of the GPT-generated population and compared these with Census data. Our findings show some alignment in gender and age means with the actual 2020 US population, but we also found mismatches in the distributions of racial and educational groups. Furthermore, there were significant differences between the distribution of GPT's responses and human self-reported attitudes. While the overall point estimates of GPT's income attitudinal responses seem to align with the mean of the population occasionally, their response distributions follow a normal distribution that diverges from human responses. In terms of gender relations, GPT's answers tend to cluster around a single category, demonstrating a deterministic pattern. We conclude by emphasizing the distinct design philosophies of LLMs and social surveys: LLMs aim to predict the most suitable answers, while social surveys seek to reveal the heterogeneity among social groups.},

In this paper, we introduce a new way of diagnosing whether ICL is functionally equivalent to gradient-based learning. Our approach is based on the inverse frequency effect (IFE) -- a phenomenon in which an error-driven learner is expected to show larger updates when trained on infrequent examples than frequent ones. The IFE has previously been studied in psycholinguistics because humans show this effect in the context of structural priming (the tendency for people to produce sentence structures they have encountered recently); the IFE has been used as evidence that human structural priming must involve error-driven learning mechanisms. In our experiments, we simulated structural priming within ICL and found that LLMs display the IFE, with the effect being stronger in larger models. We conclude that ICL is indeed a type of gradient-based learning, supporting the hypothesis that a gradient component is implicitly computed in the forward pass during ICL. Our results suggest that both humans and LLMs make use of gradient-based, error-driven processing mechanisms.},

To test this, we conducted a 2 between (Cyberball condition: exclusion vs. fair play) {\texttimes} 2 within (coplayer type: AGENT vs. HUMAN) online experiment employing the Cyberball paradigm; we investigated how participants (N = 244) responded when they observed an AI virtual agent being ostracised or treated fairly by another human in Cyberball, and we compared our results with those from human--human Cyberball research. We found that participants mindlessly applied the social norm of inclusion, compensating the ostracised agent by tossing the ball to them more frequently, just as people would to an ostracised human. This finding suggests that individuals tend to mindlessly treat AI virtual agents as social beings, supporting the media equation theory; however, age (no other user characteristics) influenced this tendency, with younger participants less likely to mindlessly apply the inclusion norm. We also found that participants showed increased sympathy towards the ostracised agent, but they did not devalue the human player for their ostracising behaviour; this indicates that participants did not mindfully perceive AI virtual agents as comparable to humans. Furthermore, we uncovered two other exploratory findings: the association between frequency of agent usage and sympathy, and the carryover effect of positive usage experience. Our study advances the theoretical understanding of the human side of human--agent interaction. Practically, it provides implications for the design of AI virtual agents, including the consideration of social norms, caution in human-like design, and age-specific targeting.},

Using data from a remotely piloted aircraft system (RPAS) task involving human-AI and all-human teams, the current study employed comparative analysis to investigate communication timing and sequence. Findings indicated that while all-human and human-AI team communication dynamics may differ in terms of timing, it is the sequencing of communicative messages that predicts team performance.

However, larger and more instructable large language models may have become less reliable. By studying the relationship between difficulty concordance, task avoidance and prompting stability of several language model families, here we show that easy instances for human participants are also easy for the models, but scaled-up, shaped-up models do not secure areas of low difficulty in which either the model does not err or human supervision can spot the errors. We also find that early models often avoid user questions but scaled-up, shaped-up models tend to give an apparently sensible yet wrong answer much more often, including errors on difficult questions that human supervisors frequently overlook. Moreover, we observe that stability to different natural phrasings of the same question is improved by scaling-up and shaping-up interventions, but pockets of variability persist across difficulty levels. These findings highlight the need for a fundamental shift in the design and development of general-purpose artificial intelligence, particularly in high-stakes areas for which a predictable distribution of errors is paramount.},

  abstract = {The use of large language models (LLM), especially ChatGPT, to help with research has come into practice. Researchers use it for timely advice and hope to obtain in-depth feedback. However, can LLM be a qualified and reliable reviewer? Although there already exist several review-related datasets, few works have carefully and thoroughly inspected model's capability as a reviewer, especially the correctness of generated reviews. In this paper, we first evaluate GPT-3.5 and GPT-4 (the current top-performing LLM) on 2 types of tasks under different settings: the score prediction task and the review generation task. In addition, we propose a dataset containing 197 review-revision multiple-choice questions (RR-MCQ) with detailed labels from the review-rebuttal forum in ICLR-2023. By asking questions from technical details to the overall presentation and quality, our RR-MCQ data provides a more complete model ability assessment. The results show that LLM is generally helpful, but great caution is needed as it always makes mistakes. Although it can give passable decisions ({\textbackslash}textgreater 60\% accuracy) on single options, completely correct answers are still rare (about 20\%); models are still weak on long paper processing, zero-shot scoring, and giving critical feedback like human reviewers.},

  abstract = {As AI systems continue to grow, particularly generative models like Large Language Models (LLMs), their rigorous evaluation is crucial for development and deployment. To determine their adequacy, researchers have developed various large-scale benchmarks against a so-called gold-standard test set and report metrics averaged across all items. However, this static evaluation paradigm increasingly shows its limitations, including high computational costs, data contamination, and the impact of low-quality or erroneous items on evaluation reliability and efficiency. In this Perspective, drawing from human psychometrics, we discuss a paradigm shift from static evaluation methods to adaptive testing. This involves estimating the characteristics and value of each test item in the benchmark and dynamically adjusting items in real-time, tailoring the evaluation based on the model's ongoing performance instead of relying on a fixed test set. This paradigm not only provides a more robust ability estimation but also significantly reduces the number of test items required. We analyze the current approaches, advantages, and underlying reasons for adopting psychometrics in AI evaluation. We propose that adaptive testing will become the new norm in AI model evaluation, enhancing both the efficiency and effectiveness of assessing advanced intelligence systems.},

  abstract = {The observed similarities in the behavior of humans and Large Language Models (LLMs) have prompted researchers to consider the potential of using LLMs as models of human cognition. However, several significant challenges must be addressed before LLMs can be legitimately regarded as cognitive models. For instance, LLMs are trained on far more data than humans typically encounter, and may have been directly trained on human data in specific cognitive tasks or aligned with human preferences. Consequently, the origins of these behavioral similarities are not well understood. In this paper, we propose a novel way to enhance the utility of LLMs as cognitive models. This approach involves (i) leveraging computationally equivalent tasks that both an LLM and a rational agent need to master for solving a cognitive problem and (ii) examining the specific task distributions required for an LLM to exhibit human-like behaviors. We apply this approach to decision-making -- specifically risky and intertemporal choice --where the key computationally equivalent task is the arithmetic of expected value calculations. We show that an LLM pretrained on an ecologically valid arithmetic dataset, which we call Arithmetic-GPT, predicts human behavior better than many traditional cognitive models. Pretraining LLMs on ecologically valid arithmetic datasets is sufficient to produce a strong correspondence between these models and human decision-making. Our results also suggest that LLMs used as cognitive models should be carefully investigated via ablation studies of the pretraining data.},

  abstract = {Large language models (LLMs) have exhibited impressive competency in various text-related tasks. However, their opaque internal mechanisms become a hindrance to leveraging them in mathematical problems. In this paper, we study a fundamental question: whether language models understand numbers, which play a basic element in mathematical problems. We assume that to solve mathematical problems, language models should be capable of understanding numbers and compressing these numbers in their hidden states. We construct a synthetic dataset comprising addition problems and utilize linear probes to read out input numbers from the hidden states of models. Experimental results demonstrate evidence supporting the existence of compressed numbers in the LLaMA-2 model family from early layers. However, the compression process seems to be not lossless, presenting difficulty in precisely reconstructing the original numbers. Further experiments show that language models can utilize the encoded numbers to perform arithmetic computations, and the computational ability scales up with the model size. Our preliminary research suggests that language models exhibit a partial understanding of numbers, offering insights into future investigations about the models' capability of solving mathematical problems.},

  abstract = {Conversational Recommender System (CRS) leverages real-time feedback from users to dynamically model their preferences, thereby enhancing the system's ability to provide personalized recommendations and improving the overall user experience. CRS has demonstrated significant promise, prompting researchers to concentrate their efforts on developing user simulators that are both more realistic and trustworthy. The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) has marked the onset of a new epoch in computational capabilities, exhibiting human-level intelligence in various tasks. Research efforts have been made to utilize LLMs for building user simulators to evaluate the performance of CRS. Although these efforts showcase innovation, they are accompanied by certain limitations. In this work, we introduce a Controllable, Scalable, and Human-Involved (CSHI) simulator framework that manages the behavior of user simulators across various stages via a plugin manager. CSHI customizes the simulation of user behavior and interactions to provide a more lifelike and convincing user interaction experience. Through experiments and case studies in two conversational recommendation scenarios, we show that our framework can adapt to a variety of conversational recommendation settings and effectively simulate users' personalized preferences. Consequently, our simulator is able to generate feedback that closely mirrors that of real users. This facilitates a reliable assessment of existing CRS studies and promotes the creation of high-quality conversational recommendation datasets.},

  abstract = {Large Language Models (LLMs) like ChatGPT are capable of successfully performing many language processing tasks zero-shot (without the need for training data). If this capacity also applies to the coding of social phenomena like persuasiveness and political ideology, then LLMs could effectively transform Computational Social Science (CSS). This work provides a road map for using LLMs as CSS tools. Towards this end, we contribute a set of prompting best practices and an extensive evaluation pipeline to measure the zero-shot performance of 13 language models on 24 representative CSS benchmarks. On taxonomic labeling tasks (classification), LLMs fail to outperform the best fine-tuned models but still achieve fair levels of agreement with humans. On free-form coding tasks (generation), LLMs produce explanations that often exceed the quality of crowdworkers' gold references. We conclude that today's LLMs can radically augment the CSS research pipeline in two ways: (1) serving as zero-shot data annotators on human annotation teams, and (2) bootstrapping challenging creative generation tasks (e.g., explaining the hidden meaning behind text). In summary, LLMs can significantly reduce costs and increase efficiency of social science analysis in partnership with humans.},

  abstract = {Artificial intelligence systems, particularly large language models (LLMs), are increasingly being employed in high-stakes decisions that impact both individuals and society at large, often without adequate safeguards to ensure safety, quality, and equity. Yet LLMs hallucinate, lack common sense, and are biased - shortcomings that may reflect LLMs' inherent limitations and thus may not be remedied by more sophisticated architectures, more data, or more human feedback. Relying solely on LLMs for complex, high-stakes decisions is therefore problematic. Here we present a hybrid collective intelligence system that mitigates these risks by leveraging the complementary strengths of human experience and the vast information processed by LLMs. We apply our method to open-ended medical diagnostics, combining 40,762 differential diagnoses made by physicians with the diagnoses of five state-of-the art LLMs across 2,133 medical cases. We show that hybrid collectives of physicians and LLMs outperform both single physicians and physician collectives, as well as single LLMs and LLM ensembles. This result holds across a range of medical specialties and professional experience, and can be attributed to humans' and LLMs' complementary contributions that lead to different kinds of errors. Our approach highlights the potential for collective human and machine intelligence to improve accuracy in complex, open-ended domains like medical diagnostics.},
