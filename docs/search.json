Human-AI teaming: Leveraging transactive memory and speaking up for enhanced team effectiveness. Frontiers in Psychology, 14. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1208019\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nIn this prospective observational study, we investigate the role of transactive memory and speaking up in human-AI teams comprising 180 intensive care (ICU) physicians and nurses working with AI in a simulated clinical environment. Our findings indicate that interactions with AI agents differ significantly from human interactions, as accessing information from AI agents is positively linked to a team’s ability to generate novel hypotheses and demonstrate speaking-up behavior, but only in higher-performing teams. Conversely, accessing information from human team members is negatively associated with these aspects, regardless of team performance. This study is a valuable contribution to the expanding field of research on human-AI teams and team science in general, as it emphasizes the necessity of incorporating AI agents as knowledge sources in a team’s transactive memory system, as well as highlighting their role as catalysts for speaking up. Practical implications include suggestions for the design of future AI systems and human-AI team training in healthcare and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBienefeld et al. (2023)",

The results reveal that (a) a TMS forms through communication about expertise; (b) as a TMS develops, communication to allocate information and coordinate retrieval increases, promoting information exchange; and (c) groups update their TMS through communicative learning. However, direct interpersonal communication is not necessary for TMS development or utilization. Nor do high-quality information-sharing processes always occur within developed TMS structures. For future research, we propose a multidimensional network approach to TMS that incorporates technologies, addresses member characteristics, considers multiple communication types, and situates groups in context.",

We describe an “alignment system” as a loosely interconnected set of cognitive processes that facilitate social interactions. As a dynamic, multi-component system, it is responsive to higher-level cognitive states such as shared beliefs and intentions (those involving collective intentionality) but can also give rise to such shared cognitive states via bottom-up processes. As an example of putative group cognition we turn to transactive memory and suggest how further research on alignment in these cases might reveal how such systems can be genuinely described as cognitive. Finally, we address a prominent critique of collective cognitive systems, arguing that there is much empirical and explanatory benefit to be gained from considering the possibility of group cognitive systems, especially in the context of small-group human interaction.",

We envision machines that are not just tools for thought, but partners in thought: reasonable, insightful, knowledgeable, reliable, and trustworthy systems that think with us. Current artificial intelligence (AI) systems satisfy some of these criteria, some of the time. In this Perspective, we show how the science of collaborative cognition can be put to work to engineer systems that really can be called “thought partners,” systems built to meet our expectations and complement our limitations. We lay out several modes of collaborative thought in which humans and AI thought partners can engage and propose desiderata for human-compatible thought partnerships. Drawing on motifs from computational cognitive science, we motivate an alternative scaling path for the design of thought partners and ecosystems around their use through a Bayesian lens, whereby the partners we construct actively build and reason over models of the human and world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Collins et al.

Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 5(CSCW1), 1–21. https://doi.org/10.1145/3449287\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nPeople supported by AI-powered decision support tools frequently overrely on the AI: they accept an AI’s suggestion even when that suggestion is wrong. Adding explanations to the AI decisions does not appear to reduce the overreliance and some studies suggest that it might even increase it. Informed by the dual-process theory of cognition, we posit that people rarely engage analytically with each individual AI recommendation and explanation, and instead develop general heuristics about whether and when to follow the AI suggestions. Building on prior research on medical decision-making, we designed three cognitive forcing interventions to compel people to engage more thoughtfully with the AI-generated explanations. We conducted an experiment (N=199), in which we compared our three cognitive forcing designs to two simple explainable AI approaches and to a no-AI baseline. The results demonstrate that cognitive forcing significantly reduced overreliance compared to the simple explainable AI approaches. However, there was a trade-off: people assigned the least favorable subjective ratings to the designs that reduced the overreliance the most. To audit our work for intervention-generated inequalities, we investigated whether our interventions benefited equally people with different levels of Need for Cognition (i.e., motivation to engage in effortful mental activities). Our results show that, on average, cognitive forcing interventions benefited participants higher in Need for Cognition more. Our research suggests that human cognitive motivation moderates the effectiveness of explainable AI solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Buçinca et al. (2021)",

LLMs have been shown to contain human biases due to the data they have been trained on; whether this is reflected in rational reasoning remains less clear. In this paper, we answer this question by evaluating seven language models using tasks from the cognitive psychology literature. We find that, like humans, LLMs display irrationality in these tasks. However, the way this irrationality is displayed does not reflect that shown by humans. When incorrect answers are given by LLMs to these tasks, they are often incorrect in ways that differ from human-like biases. On top of this, the LLMs reveal an additional layer of irrationality in the significant inconsistency of the responses. Aside from the experimental results, this paper seeks to make a methodological contribution by showing how we can assess and compare different capabilities of these types of models, in this case with respect to rational reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figures from Macmillan-Scott & Musolesi (2024)",

We presented to human participants and an array of pretrained LLMs new variants of classical cognitive experiments, and cross-compared their performances. Our results showed that most of the included models presented reasoning errors akin to those frequently ascribed to error-prone, heuristic-based human reasoning. Notwithstanding this superficial similarity, an in-depth comparison between humans and LLMs indicated important differences with human-like reasoning, with models’ limitations disappearing almost entirely in more recent LLMs’ releases. Moreover, we show that while it is possible to devise strategies to induce better performance, humans and machines are not equally responsive to the same prompting schemes. We conclude by discussing the epistemological implications and challenges of comparing human and machine behavior for both artificial intelligence and cognitive psychology.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Yax et al.

Psychologists currently answer such questions with psychometric methods, which analyze correlations across participant responses in survey data sets. In this article, we analyze the preferences that give rise to these correlations. Our approach uses (a) large language models (LLMs) to quantify everyday risky behaviors in terms of the attributes or reasons that may describe those behaviors, and (b) decision models to map these attributes and reasons onto participant responses. We show that LLM-based decision models can explain observed correlations between behaviors in terms of the reasons different behaviors elicit and explain observed correlations between individuals in terms of the weights different individuals place on reasons, thereby providing a decision theoretic foundation for psychometric findings. Since LLMs can generate quantitative representations for nearly any naturalistic decision, they can be used to make accurate out-of-sample predictions for hundreds of everyday behaviors, predict the reasons why people may or may not want to engage in these behaviors, and interpret these reasons in terms of core psychological constructs. Our approach has important theoretical and practical implications for the study of heterogeneity in everyday behavior.\n\n\nBhatia (2024)",

However, people’s perception and understanding are often distorted by their cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, anchoring bias, availability bias, to name a few. In this work, we use knowledge from the field of cognitive science to account for cognitive biases in the human-AI collaborative decision-making setting, and mitigate their negative effects on collaborative performance. To this end, we mathematically model cognitive biases and provide a general framework through which researchers and practitioners can understand the interplay between cognitive biases and human-AI accuracy. We then focus specifically on anchoring bias, a bias commonly encountered in human-AI collaboration. We implement a time-based de-anchoring strategy and conduct our first user experiment that validates its effectiveness in human-AI collaborative decision-making. With this result, we design a time allocation strategy for a resource-constrained setting that achieves optimal human-AI collaboration under some assumptions. We, then, conduct a second user experiment which shows that our time allocation strategy with explanation can effectively de-anchor the human and improve collaborative performance when the AI model has low confidence and is incorrect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Figures from Rastogi et al.

Still, it is often ineffective; impaired perceptions – such as low trust or limited understanding – reduce compliance with recommendations provided by the AI system. Drawing from cognitive load theory, we examine two techniques of human-AI collaboration as potential remedies. In three experimental studies, we grant users decision control by empowering them to adjust the system’s recommendations, and we offer explanations for the system’s reasoning. We find decision control positively affects user perceptions of trust and understanding, and improves user compliance with system recommendations. Next, we isolate different effects of providing explanations that may help explain inconsistent findings in recent literature: while explanations help reenact the system’s reasoning, they also increase task complexity. Further, the effectiveness of providing an explanation depends on the specific user’s cognitive ability to handle complex tasks. In summary, our study shows that users benefit from enhanced decision control, while explanations – unless appropriately designed for the specific user – may even harm user perceptions and compliance. This work bears both theoretical and practical implications for the management of human-AI collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Westphal et al. (2023)",

Adopting a pragmatic approach, this study investigated the response patterns of AI chatbots—specifically, large language models (LLMs)—to various emotional primes. We engaged AI chatbots as one would human participants, presenting scenarios designed to elicit positive, negative, or neutral emotional states. Multiple accounts of OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus were then tasked with responding to inquiries concerning investment decisions and prosocial behaviors. Our analysis revealed that ChatGPT-4 bots, when primed with positive, negative, or neutral emotions, exhibited distinct response patterns in both risk-taking and prosocial decisions, a phenomenon less evident in the ChatGPT-3.5 iterations. This observation suggests an enhanced capacity for modulating responses based on emotional cues in more advanced LLMs. While these findings do not suggest the presence of emotions in AI, they underline the feasibility of swaying AI responses by leveraging emotional indicators.\n\n\n\n\n\nZhao et al.

Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT)-3.5 is an example of an LLM that supports a conversational agent called ChatGPT. In this work, we used a series of novel prompts to determine whether ChatGPT shows heuristics and other context-sensitive responses. We also tested the same prompts on human participants. Across four studies, we found that ChatGPT was influenced by random anchors in making estimates (anchoring, Study 1); it judged the likelihood of two events occurring together to be higher than the likelihood of either event occurring alone, and it was influenced by anecdotal information (representativeness and availability heuristic, Study 2); it found an item to be more efficacious when its features were presented positively rather than negatively—even though both presentations contained statistically equivalent information (framing effect, Study 3); and it valued an owned item more than a newly found item even though the two items were objectively identical (endowment effect, Study 4). In each study, human participants showed similar effects. Heuristics and context-sensitive responses in humans are thought to be driven by cognitive and affective processes such as loss aversion and effort reduction. The fact that an LLM—which lacks these processes—also shows such responses invites consideration of the possibility that language is sufficiently rich to carry these effects and may play a role in generating these effects in humans.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Suri et al.

Leveraging the extensive literature on intertemporal discounting for benchmarking, we examine responses from LLMs across various languages and compare them with human responses, exploring preferences between smaller, sooner and larger, later rewards. Our findings reveal that both generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models demonstrate less patience than humans, with GPT-3.5 exhibiting a lexicographic preference for earlier rewards unlike human decision makers. Although GPT-4 does not display lexicographic preferences, its measured discount rates are still considerably larger than those found in humans. Interestingly, GPT models show greater patience in languages with weak future tense references, such as German and Mandarin, aligning with the existing literature that suggests a correlation between language structure and intertemporal preferences. We demonstrate how prompting GPT to explain its decisions, a procedure we term “chain-of-thought conjoint,” can mitigate, but does not eliminate, discrepancies between LLM and human responses. Although directly eliciting preferences using LLMs may yield misleading results, combining chain-of-thought conjoint with topic modeling aids in hypothesis generation, enabling researchers to explore the underpinnings of preferences. Chain-of-thought conjoint provides a structured framework for marketers to use LLMs to identify potential attributes or factors that can explain preference heterogeneity across different customers and contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Figures from Goli & Singh (2024)",

Large language models (LMs) achieve above-chance performance on abstract reasoning tasks but exhibit many imperfections. However, human abstract reasoning is also imperfect. Human reasoning is affected by our real-world knowledge and beliefs, and shows notable “content effects”; humans reason more reliably when the semantic content of a problem supports the correct logical inferences. These content-entangled reasoning patterns are central to debates about the fundamental nature of human intelligence. Here, we investigate whether language models—whose prior expectations capture some aspects of human knowledge—similarly mix content into their answers to logic problems. We explored this question across three logical reasoning tasks: natural language inference, judging the logical validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. We evaluate state of the art LMs, as well as humans, and find that the LMs reflect many of the same qualitative human patterns on these tasks—like humans, models answer more accurately when the semantic content of a task supports the logical inferences. These parallels are reflected in accuracy patterns, and in some lower-level features like the relationship between LM confidence over possible answers and human response times. However, in some cases the humans and models behave differently—particularly on the Wason task, where humans perform much worse than large models, and exhibit a distinct error pattern. Our findings have implications for understanding possible contributors to these human cognitive effects, as well as the factors that influence language model performance.\n\n\nLampinen et al.

This paper examines the economic rationality of GPT by instructing it to make budgetary decisions in four domains: risk, time, social, and food preferences. We measure economic rationality by assessing the consistency of GPT’s decisions with utility maximization in classic revealed preference theory. We find that GPT’s decisions are largely rational in each domain and demonstrate higher rationality score than those of human subjects in a parallel experiment and in the literature. Moreover, the estimated preference parameters of GPT are slightly different from human subjects and exhibit a lower degree of heterogeneity. We also find that the rationality scores are robust to the degree of randomness and demographic settings such as age and gender but are sensitive to contexts based on the language frames of the choice situations. These results suggest the potential of LLMs to make good decisions and the need to further understand their capabilities, limitations, and underlying mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Chen et al.

Furthermore, even if a model shows a significant change in the same direction as humans, we find that they are sensitive to perturbations that do not elicit significant changes in humans.

Because Cognitive Architectures are famously developed for the purpose of modeling the internal mechanisms of human cognitive decision-making at a computational level, new investigations consider the goal of informing LLMs with the knowledge necessary for replicating such processes, e.g., guided perception, memory, goal-setting, and action. Previous approaches that use LLMs for grounded decision-making struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require slower, deliberate cognition over fast and intuitive inference—reporting issues related to the lack of sufficient grounding, as in hallucination. To resolve these challenges, we introduce LLM-ACTR, a novel neurosymbolic architecture that provides human-aligned and versatile decision-making by integrating the ACT-R Cognitive Architecture with LLMs. Our framework extracts and embeds knowledge of ACT-R’s internal decision-making process as latent neural representations, injects this information into trainable LLM adapter layers, and fine-tunes the LLMs for downstream prediction. Our experiments on novel Design for Manufacturing tasks show both improved task performance as well as improved grounded decision-making capability of our approach, compared to LLM-only baselines that leverage chain-of-thought reasoning strategies.",

Large Language Models Amplify Human Biases in Moral Decision-Making (https://osf.io/3kvjd/). https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/aj46b\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nAs large language models (LLMs) become more widely used, people increasingly rely on them to make or advise on moral decisions. Some researchers even propose using LLMs as participants in psychology experiments. It is therefore important to understand how well LLMs make moral decisions and how they compare to humans. We investigated this question in realistic moral dilemmas using prompts where GPT-4, Llama 3, and Claude 3 give advice and where they emulate a research participant. In Study 1, we compared responses from LLMs to a representative US sample (N = 285) for 22 dilemmas: social dilemmas that pitted self-interest against the greater good, and moral dilemmas that pitted utilitarian cost-benefit reasoning against deontological rules. In social dilemmas, LLMs were more altruistic than participants. In moral dilemmas, LLMs exhibited stronger omission bias than participants: they usually endorsed inaction over action. In Study 2 (N = 490, preregistered), we replicated this omission bias and document an additional bias: unlike humans, LLMs (except GPT-4o) tended to answer “no” in moral dilemmas, whereby the phrasing of the question influences the decision even when physical action remains the same. Our findings show that LLM moral decision-making amplifies human biases and introduces potentially problematic biases.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Cheung et al. (2024)",

Structuring Knowledge with Cognitive Maps and Cognitive Graphs. Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 25(1), 37–54. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2020.10.004\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nHumans and animals use mental representations of the spatial structure of the world to navigate. The classical view is that these representations take the form of Euclidean cognitive maps, but alternative theories suggest that they are cognitive graphs consisting of locations connected by paths. We review evidence suggesting that both map-like and graph-like representations exist in the mind/brain that rely on partially overlapping neural systems. Maps and graphs can operate simultaneously or separately, and they may be applied to both spatial and nonspatial knowledge. By providing structural frameworks for complex information, cognitive maps and cognitive graphs may provide fundamental organizing schemata that allow us to navigate in physical, social, and conceptual spaces.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figures from Peer et al.

Wormholes in virtual space: From cognitive maps to cognitive graphs. Cognition, 166, 152–163. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2017.05.020\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nHumans and other animals build up spatial knowledge of the environment on the basis of visual information and path integration. We compare three hypotheses about the geometry of this knowledge of navigation space: (a) ‘cognitive map’ with metric Euclidean structure and a consistent coordinate system, (b) ‘topological graph’ or network of paths between places, and (c) ‘labelled graph’ incorporating local metric information about path lengths and junction angles. In two experiments, participants walked in a non-Euclidean environment, a virtual hedge maze containing two ‘wormholes’ that visually rotated and teleported them between locations. During training, they learned the metric locations of eight target objects from a ‘home’ location, which were visible individually. During testing, shorter wormhole routes to a target were preferred, and novel shortcuts were directional, contrary to the topological hypothesis. Shortcuts were strongly biased by the wormholes, with mean constant errors of 37° and 41° (45° expected), revealing violations of the metric postulates in spatial knowledge. In addition, shortcuts to targets near wormholes shifted relative to flanking targets, revealing ‘rips’ (86% of cases), ‘folds’ (91%), and ordinal reversals (66%) in spatial knowledge. Moreover, participants were completely unaware of these geometric inconsistencies, reflecting a surprising insensitivity to Euclidean structure. The probability of the shortcut data under the Euclidean map model and labelled graph model indicated decisive support for the latter (BFGM&gt;100). We conclude that knowledge of navigation space is best characterized by a labelled graph, in which local metric information is approximate, geometrically inconsistent, and not embedded in a common coordinate system. This class of ‘cognitive graph’ models supports route finding, novel detours, and rough shortcuts, and has the potential to unify a range of data on spatial navigation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Warren et al. 2017\n\n\n\n\n\nRoute effects in city-based survey knowledge estimates\nKrukar, J., Navas Medrano, S., & Schwering, A. (2023). Route effects in city-based survey knowledge estimates. Cognitive Processing, 24(2), 213–231. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10339-022-01122-0\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nWhen studying wayfinding in urban environments, researchers are often interested in obtaining measures of participants’ survey knowledge, i.e., their estimate of distant locations relative to other places. Previous work showed that distance estimations are consistently biased when no direct route is available to the queried target or when participants follow a detour. Here we investigated whether a corresponding bias is manifested in two other popular measures of survey knowledge: a pointing task and a sketchmapping task. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a systematic bias in pointing/sketchmapping performance associated with the preferred route choice in an applied urban setting. The results were mixed. We found moderate evidence for the presence of a systematic bias, but only for a subset of urban locations. When two plausible routes to the target were available, survey knowledge estimates were significantly biased in the direction of the route chosen by the participant. When only one plausible route was available, we did not find a statistically significant pattern. The results may have methodological implications for spatial cognition studies in applied urban settings that might be obtaining systematically biased survey knowledge estimates at some urban locations. Researchers should be aware that the choice of urban locations from which pointing and sketchmapping are performed might systematically distort the results, in particular when two plausible but diverging routes to the target are visible from the location.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Figures from Krukar et al.

Spatial decision dynamics during wayfinding: Intersections prompt the decision-making process. Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications, 3(1), 13. https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-018-0098-3\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nIntersections are critical decision points for wayfinders, but it is unknown how decision dynamics unfold during pedestrian wayfinding. Some research implies that pedestrians leverage available visual cues to actively compare options while in an intersection, whereas other research suggests that people strive to make decisions long before overt responses are required. Two experiments examined these possibilities while participants navigated virtual desktop environments, assessing information-seeking behavior (Experiment 1) and movement dynamics (Experiment 2) while approaching intersections. In Experiment 1, we found that participants requested navigation guidance while in path segments approaching an intersection and the guidance facilitated choice behavior. In Experiment 2, we found that participants tended to orient themselves toward an upcoming turn direction before entering an intersection, particularly as they became more familiar with the environment. Some of these patterns were modulated by individual differences in spatial ability, sense of direction, spatial strategies, and gender. Together, we provide novel evidence that deciding whether to continue straight or turn involves a dynamic, distributed decision-making process that is prompted by upcoming intersections and modulated by individual differences and environmental experience. We discuss implications of these results for spatial decision-making theory and the development of innovative adaptive, beacon-based navigation guidance systems.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Brunyé et al.

Cognition, 200, 104276. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2020.104276\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nWe tested four hypotheses about the structure of spatial knowledge used for navigation: (1) the Euclidean hypothesis, a geometrically consistent map; (2) the Neighborhood hypothesis, adjacency relations between spatial regions, based on visible boundaries; (3) the Cognitive Graph hypothesis, a network of paths between places, labeled with approximate local distances and angles; and (4) the Constancy hypothesis, whatever geometric properties are invariant during learning. In two experiments, different groups of participants learned three virtual hedge mazes, which varied specific geometric properties (Euclidean Control Maze, Elastic Maze with stretching paths, Swap Maze with alternating paths to the same place). Spatial knowledge was then tested using three navigation tasks (metric shortcuts on empty ground plane, neighborhood shortcuts with visible boundaries, route task in corridors). They yielded the following results: (a) Metric shortcuts were insensitive to detectable shifts in target location, inconsistent with the Euclidean hypothesis. (b) Neighborhood shortcuts were constrained by visible boundaries in the Elastic Maze, but not in the Swap Maze, contrary to the Neighborhood and Constancy hypotheses. (c) The route task indicated that a graph of the maze was acquired in all environments, including knowledge of local path lengths. We conclude that primary spatial knowledge is consistent with the Cognitive Graph hypothesis. Neighborhoods are derived from the graph, and local distance and angle information is not embedded in a geometrically consistent map.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Figures from Ericson & Warren (2020)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRational use of cognitive resources in human planning\nCallaway, F., Van Opheusden, B., Gul, S., Das, P., Krueger, P.

IEEE Transactions on Visualization and Computer Graphics. https://doi.org/10.1109/TVCG.2019.2934555\nlink to code on github\nproject page\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nWe present Scalable Insets, a technique for interactively exploring and navigating large numbers of annotated patterns in multiscale visualizations such as gigapixel images, matrices, or maps. Exploration of many but sparsely-distributed patterns in multiscale visualizations is challenging as visual representations change across zoom levels, context and navigational cues get lost upon zooming, and navigation is time consuming. Our technique visualizes annotated patterns too small to be identifiable at certain zoom levels using insets, i.e., magnified thumbnail views of the annotated patterns. Insets support users in searching, comparing, and contextualizing patterns while reducing the amount of navigation needed. They are dynamically placed either within the viewport or along the boundary of the viewport to offer a compromise between locality and context preservation. Annotated patterns are interactively clustered by location and type. They are visually represented as an aggregated inset to provide scalable exploration within a single viewport. In a controlled user study with 18 participants, we found that Scalable Insets can speed up visual search and improve the accuracy of pattern comparison at the cost of slower frequency estimation compared to a baseline technique. A second study with 6 experts in the field of genomics showed that Scalable Insets is easy to learn and provides first insights into how Scalable Insets can be applied in an open-ended data exploration scenario.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Lekschas et al.

(2024). Personality traits and spatial skills are related to group dynamics and success during collective wayfinding. Collective Spatial Cognition, 60-99.\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThis chapter reviews and identifies gaps in research examining collective navigation and describes the results of a small study aimed at better elucidating the independent and interactive roles of personality and spatial skill in guiding group wayfinding dynamics, wayfinding performance, and spatial memory. In this study, individuals, dyads, and triads completed a series of individual differences tasks and questionnaires, and an individual or shared (dyads and triads) virtual wayfinding experience involving planning and executing routes between origin and destination pairs. Navigators were provided with a single digital map that they could share during the task; patterns of map sharing, virtual navigation, and wayfinding performance were logged. Higher spatial anxiety was associated with more map viewing among group members, higher scores on questionnaires assessing autism-type traits were associated with lower group cohesion, higher group heterogeneity was associated with lower group cohesion and lower path efficiency, and triads tended to have poorer memory for the location of goal locations relative to individuals and dyads. Results speak to the inherent complexity and dynamics of collective navigation, the need for understanding individual differences in guiding group behavior, and the value of continuing research in this domain.\n\n\nBrunyé et al.

Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications, 9(1), 40. https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-024-00563-9\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nNavigation is essential to life, and it is cognitively complex, drawing on abilities such as prospective and situated planning, spatial memory, location recognition, and real-time decision-making. In many cases, day-to-day navigation is embedded in a social context where cognition and behavior are shaped by others, but the great majority of existing research in spatial cognition has focused on individuals. The two studies we report here contribute to our understanding of social wayfinding, assessing the performance of paired and individual navigators on a real-world wayfinding task in which they were instructed to minimize time and distance traveled. In the first study, we recruited 30 pairs of friends (familiar dyads); in the second, we recruited 30 solo participants (individuals). We compare the two studies to the results of an earlier study of 30 pairs of strangers (unfamiliar dyads). We draw out differences in performance with respect to spatial, social, and cognitive considerations. Of the three conditions, solo participants were least successful in reaching the destination accurately on their initial attempt. Friends traveled more efficiently than either strangers or individuals. Working with a partner also appeared to lend confidence to wayfinders: dyads of either familiarity type were more persistent than individuals in the navigation task, even after encountering challenges or making incorrect attempts. Route selection was additionally impacted by route complexity and unfamiliarity with the study area. Navigators explicitly used ease of remembering as a planning criterion, and the resulting differences in route complexity likely influenced success during enacted navigation.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Figures from Bae et al.

Scientific Reports, 11(1), Article 1. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-021-87717-7\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nHumans and other complex organisms exhibit intelligent behaviors as individual agents and as groups of coordinated agents. They can switch between independent and collective modes of behavior, and flexible switching can be advantageous for adapting to ongoing changes in conditions. In the present study, we investigated the flexibility between independent and collective modes of behavior in a simulated social foraging task designed to benefit from both modes: distancing among ten foraging agents promoted faster detection of resources, whereas flocking promoted faster consumption. There was a tradeoff between faster detection versus faster consumption, but both factors contributed to foraging success. Results showed that group foraging performance among simulated agents was enhanced by loose coupling that balanced distancing and flocking among agents and enabled them to fluidly switch among a variety of groupings. We also examined the effects of more sophisticated cognitive capacities by studying how human players improve performance when they control one of the search agents. Results showed that human intervention further enhanced group performance with loosely coupled agents, and human foragers performed better when coordinating with loosely coupled agents. Humans players adapted their balance of independent versus collective search modes in response to the dynamics of simulated agents, thereby demonstrating the importance of adaptive flexibility in social foraging.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigures from Schloesser et al.

Science, 386(6719), eadq2852. https://doi.org/10.1126/science.adq2852\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nFinding agreement through a free exchange of views is often difficult. Collective deliberation can be slow, difficult to scale, and unequally attentive to different voices. In this study, we trained an artificial intelligence (AI) to mediate human deliberation. Using participants’ personal opinions and critiques, the AI mediator iteratively generates and refines statements that express common ground among the group on social or political issues. Participants (N = 5734) preferred AI-generated statements to those written by human mediators, rating them as more informative, clear, and unbiased. Discussants often updated their views after the deliberation, converging on a shared perspective. Text embeddings revealed that successful group statements incorporated dissenting voices while respecting the majority position. These findings were replicated in a virtual citizens’ assembly involving a demographically representative sample of the UK population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figures from Tessler et al.

Task Allocation in Teams as a Multi-Armed Bandit. https://cocosci.princeton.edu/papers/marjieh2024task.pdf\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nHumans rely on efficient distribution of resources to transcend the abilities of individuals. Successful task allocation, whether in small teams or across large institutions, depends on individuals’ ability to discern their own and others’ strengths and weaknesses, and to optimally act on them. This dependence creates a tension between exploring the capabilities of others and exploiting the knowledge acquired so far, which can be challenging. How do people navigate this tension? To address this question, we propose a novel task allocation paradigm in which a human agent is asked to repeatedly allocate tasks in three distinct classes (categorizing a blurry image, detecting a noisy voice command, and solving an anagram) between themselves and two other (bot) team members to maximize team performance. We show that this problem can be recast as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit which allows us to compare people’s performance against two well-known strategies, Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). We find that humans are able to successfully integrate information about the capabilities of different team members to infer optimal allocations, and in some cases perform on par with these optimal strategies. Our approach opens up new avenues for studying the mechanisms underlying collective cooperation in teams.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Marjieh et al.

Frontiers in Psychology, 14. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1208019\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nIn this prospective observational study, we investigate the role of transactive memory and speaking up in human-AI teams comprising 180 intensive care (ICU) physicians and nurses working with AI in a simulated clinical environment. Our findings indicate that interactions with AI agents differ significantly from human interactions, as accessing information from AI agents is positively linked to a team’s ability to generate novel hypotheses and demonstrate speaking-up behavior, but only in higher-performing teams. Conversely, accessing information from human team members is negatively associated with these aspects, regardless of team performance. This study is a valuable contribution to the expanding field of research on human-AI teams and team science in general, as it emphasizes the necessity of incorporating AI agents as knowledge sources in a team’s transactive memory system, as well as highlighting their role as catalysts for speaking up. Practical implications include suggestions for the design of future AI systems and human-AI team training in healthcare and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Bienefeld et al.

Large language models empowered agent-based modeling and simulation: A survey and perspectives. Humanities and Social Sciences Communications, 11(1), 1–24. https://doi.org/10.1057/s41599-024-03611-3\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nAgent-based modeling and simulation have evolved as a powerful tool for modeling complex systems, offering insights into emergent behaviors and interactions among diverse agents. Recently, integrating large language models into agent-based modeling and simulation presents a promising avenue for enhancing simulation capabilities. This paper surveys the landscape of utilizing large language models in agent-based modeling and simulation, discussing their challenges and promising future directions. In this survey, since this is an interdisciplinary field, we first introduce the background of agent-based modeling and simulation and large language model-empowered agents. We then discuss the motivation for applying large language models to agent-based simulation and systematically analyze the challenges in environment perception, human alignment, action generation, and evaluation. Most importantly, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent works of large language model-empowered agent-based modeling and simulation in multiple scenarios, which can be divided into four domains: cyber, physical, social, and hybrid, covering simulation of both real-world and virtual environments, and how these works address the above challenges. Finally, since this area is new and quickly evolving, we discuss the open problems and promising future directions. We summarize the representative papers along with their code repositories in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/LLM-Agent-Based-Modeling-and-Simulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from C. Gao et al.

We envision machines that are not just tools for thought, but partners in thought: reasonable, insightful, knowledgeable, reliable, and trustworthy systems that think with us. Current artificial intelligence (AI) systems satisfy some of these criteria, some of the time. In this Perspective, we show how the science of collaborative cognition can be put to work to engineer systems that really can be called “thought partners,” systems built to meet our expectations and complement our limitations. We lay out several modes of collaborative thought in which humans and AI thought partners can engage and propose desiderata for human-compatible thought partnerships. Drawing on motifs from computational cognitive science, we motivate an alternative scaling path for the design of thought partners and ecosystems around their use through a Bayesian lens, whereby the partners we construct actively build and reason over models of the human and world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Collins et al.

Large Language Models for Collective Problem-Solving: Insights into Group Consensus Decision-Making. https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6s060914\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nLarge Language models (LLM) exhibit human-like proficiency in various tasks such as translation, question answering, essay writing, and programming. Emerging research explores the use of LLMs in collective problem-solving endeavors, such as tasks where groups try to uncover clues through discussions. Although prior work has investigated individual problem-solving tasks, leveraging LLM-powered agents for group consensus and decision-making remains largely unexplored. This research addresses this gap by (1) proposing an algorithm to enable free-form conversation in groups of LLM agents, (2) creating metrics to evaluate the human-likeness of the generated dialogue and problem-solving performance, and (3) evaluating LLM agent groups against human groups using an open source dataset. Our results reveal that LLM groups outperform human groups in problem-solving tasks. LLM groups also show a greater improvement in scores after participating in free discussions. In particular, analyses indicate that LLM agent groups exhibit more disagreements, complex statements, and a propensity for positive statements compared to human groups. The results shed light on the potential of LLMs to facilitate collective reasoning and provide insight into the dynamics of group interactions involving synthetic LLM agents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Figure from Du et al.

Technology in Society, 78, 102662. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.techsoc.2024.102662\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThis paper explores the effects of integrating Generative Artificial Intelligence (GAI) into decision-making processes within organizations, employing a quasi-experimental pretest-posttest design. The study examines the synergistic interaction between Human Intelligence (HI) and GAI across four group decision-making scenarios within three global organizations renowned for their cutting-edge operational techniques. The research progresses through several phases: identifying research problems, collecting baseline data on decision-making, implementing AI interventions, and evaluating the outcomes post-intervention to identify shifts in performance. The results demonstrate that GAI effectively reduces human cognitive burdens and mitigates heuristic biases by offering data-driven support and predictive analytics, grounded in System 2 reasoning. This is particularly valuable in complex situations characterized by unfamiliarity and information overload, where intuitive, System 1 thinking is less effective. However, the study also uncovers challenges related to GAI integration, such as potential over-reliance on technology, intrinsic biases particularly ‘out-of-the-box’ thinking without contextual creativity. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative strategic framework for HI-GAI collaboration that emphasizes transparency, accountability, and inclusiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Hao et al.

Nature Human Behaviour, 1–13. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-024-01959-9\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nCollective intelligence underpins the success of groups, organizations, markets and societies. Through distributed cognition and coordination, collectives can achieve outcomes that exceed the capabilities of individuals—even experts—resulting in improved accuracy and novel capabilities. Often, collective intelligence is supported by information technology, such as online prediction markets that elicit the ‘wisdom of crowds’, online forums that structure collective deliberation or digital platforms that crowdsource knowledge from the public. Large language models, however, are transforming how information is aggregated, accessed and transmitted online. Here we focus on the unique opportunities and challenges this transformation poses for collective intelligence. We bring together interdisciplinary perspectives from industry and academia to identify potential benefits, risks, policy-relevant considerations and open research questions, culminating in a call for a closer examination of how large language models affect humans’ ability to collectively tackle complex problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nBurton et al.

Towards Human-AI Deliberation: Design and Evaluation of LLM-Empowered Deliberative AI for AI-Assisted Decision-Making (arXiv:2403.16812). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16812\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nIn AI-assisted decision-making, humans often passively review AI’s suggestion and decide whether to accept or reject it as a whole. In such a paradigm, humans are found to rarely trigger analytical thinking and face difficulties in communicating the nuances of conflicting opinions to the AI when disagreements occur. To tackle this challenge, we propose Human-AI Deliberation, a novel framework to promote human reflection and discussion on conflicting human-AI opinions in decision-making. Based on theories in human deliberation, this framework engages humans and AI in dimension-level opinion elicitation, deliberative discussion, and decision updates. To empower AI with deliberative capabilities, we designed Deliberative AI, which leverages large language models (LLMs) as a bridge between humans and domain-specific models to enable flexible conversational interactions and faithful information provision. An exploratory evaluation on a graduate admissions task shows that Deliberative AI outperforms conventional explainable AI (XAI) assistants in improving humans’ appropriate reliance and task performance. Based on a mixed-methods analysis of participant behavior, perception, user experience, and open-ended feedback, we draw implications for future AI-assisted decision tool design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Figure from Ma et al.

Proceedings of the 29th International Conference on Intelligent User Interfaces, 103–119. https://doi.org/10.1145/3640543.3645199\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nGroup decision making plays a crucial role in our complex and interconnected world. The rise of AI technologies has the potential to provide data-driven insights to facilitate group decision making, although it is found that groups do not always utilize AI assistance appropriately. In this paper, we aim to examine whether and how the introduction of a devil’s advocate in the AI-assisted group deci- sion making processes could help groups better utilize AI assistance and change the perceptions of group processes during decision making. Inspired by the exceptional conversational capabilities ex- hibited by modern large language models (LLMs), we design four different styles of devil’s advocate powered by LLMs, varying their interactivity (i.e., interactive vs. non-interactive) and their target of objection (i.e., challenge the AI recommendation or the majority opinion within the group). Through a randomized human-subject experiment, we find evidence suggesting that LLM-powered devil’s advocates that argue against the AI model’s decision recommenda- tion have the potential to promote groups’ appropriate reliance on AI. Meanwhile, the introduction of LLM-powered devil’s advocate usually does not lead to substantial increases in people’s perceived workload for completing the group decision making tasks, while interactive LLM-powered devil’s advocates are perceived as more collaborating and of higher quality. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of our findings.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Chiang et al.

The Wisdom of Partisan Crowds: Comparing Collective Intelligence in Humans and LLM-based Agents. https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3k67x8s5\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nHuman groups are able to converge to more accurate beliefs through deliberation, even in the presence of polarization and partisan bias — a phenomenon known as the “wisdom of partisan crowds.” Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to simulate human collective behavior, yet few benchmarks exist for evaluating their dynamics against the behavior of human groups. In this paper, we examine the extent to which the wisdom of partisan crowds emerges in groups of LLM-based agents that are prompted to role-play as partisan personas (e.g., Democrat or Republican). We find that they not only display human-like partisan biases, but also converge to more accurate beliefs through deliberation, as humans do. We then identify several factors that interfere with convergence, including the use of chain-of-thought prompting and lack of details in personas. Conversely, fine-tuning on human data appears to enhance convergence. These findings show the potential and limitations of LLM-based agents as a model of human collective intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\nChuang et al.

ALIFE 2024: Proceedings of the 2024 Artificial Life Conference. https://doi.org/10.1162/isal_a_00730\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nHuman culture relies on collective innovation: our ability to continuously explore how existing elements in our environment can be combined to create new ones. Language is hypothesized to play a key role in human culture, driving individual cognitive capacities and shaping communication. Yet the majority of models of collective innovation assign no cognitive capacities or language abilities to agents. Here, we contribute a computational study of collective innovation where agents are Large Language Models (LLMs) that play Little Alchemy 2, a creative video game originally developed for humans that, as we argue, captures useful aspects of innovation landscapes not present in previous test-beds. We, first, study an LLM in isolation and discover that it exhibits both useful skills and crucial limitations. We, then, study groups of LLMs that share information related to their behaviour and focus on the effect of social connectivity on collective performance. In agreement with previous human and computational studies, we observe that groups with dynamic connectivity out-compete fully-connected groups. Our work reveals opportunities and challenges for future studies of collective innovation that are becoming increasingly relevant as Generative Artificial Intelligence algorithms and humans innovate alongside each other.\n\n\n\n\n\nNisioti et al.

Our key findings indicate that LLM agents role-playing detailed personas and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning closely align with human behaviors, while having CoT reasoning hurts the alignment. However, incorporating explicit biases into agent prompts does not necessarily enhance the wisdom of partisan crowds. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs with human data shows promise in achieving human-like behavior but poses a risk of overfitting certain behaviors. These findings show the potential and limitations of using LLM agents in modeling human group phenomena.\n\n\nChuang et al. (2023)\n\n\n\nZhang, J., Xu, X., Zhang, N., Liu, R., Hooi, B., & Deng, S.

Exploring Collaboration Mechanisms for LLM Agents: A Social Psychology View (arXiv:2310.02124). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.02124\nhttps://www.zjukg.org/project/MachineSoM/\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nAs Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are increasingly employed in intricate social environments, a pressing query emerges: Can these NLP systems mirror human-esque collaborative intelligence, in a multi-agent society consisting of multiple large language models (LLMs)? This paper probes the collaboration mechanisms among contemporary NLP systems by melding practical experiments with theoretical insights. We fabricate four unique ‘societies’ comprised of LLM agents, where each agent is characterized by a specific ‘trait’ (easy-going or overconfident) and engages in collaboration with a distinct ‘thinking pattern’ (debate or reflection). Through evaluating these multi-agent societies on three benchmark datasets, we discern that certain collaborative strategies not only outshine previous top-tier approaches but also optimize efficiency (using fewer API tokens). Moreover, our results further illustrate that LLM agents manifest humanlike social behaviors, such as conformity and consensus reaching, mirroring foundational social psychology theories. In conclusion, we integrate insights from social psychology to contextualize the collaboration of LLM agents, inspiring further investigations into the collaboration mechanism for LLMs. We have shared our code and datasets1, hoping to catalyze further research in this promising avenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nZhang et al.

LLM-Deliberation: Evaluating LLMs with Interactive Multi-Agent Negotiation Games. https://doi.org/10.60882/cispa.25233028.v1\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThere is a growing interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents to tackle real-world tasks that may require assessing complex situations. Yet, we have a limited understanding of LLMs’ reasoning and decision-making capabilities, partly stemming from a lack of dedicated evaluation benchmarks. As negotiating and compromising are key aspects of our everyday communication and collaboration, we propose using scorable negotiation games as a new evaluation framework for LLMs. We create a testbed of diverse text-based, multi-agent, multi-issue, semantically rich negotiation games, with easily tunable difficulty. To solve the challenge, agents need to have strong arithmetic, inference, exploration, and planning capabilities, while seamlessly integrating them. Via a systematic zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT), we show that agents can negotiate and consistently reach successful deals. We quantify the performance with multiple metrics and observe a large gap between GPT-4 and earlier models. Importantly, we test the generalization to new games and setups. Finally, we show that these games can help evaluate other critical aspects, such as the interaction dynamics between agents in the presence of greedy and adversarial players.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdelnabi et al.

LLM Voting: Human Choices and AI Collective Decision Making (arXiv:2402.01766). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01766\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThis paper investigates the voting behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and LLaMA-2, their biases, and how they align with human voting patterns. Our methodology involved using a dataset from a human voting experiment to establish a baseline for human preferences and conducting a corresponding experiment with LLM agents. We observed that the choice of voting methods and the presentation order influenced LLM voting outcomes. We found that varying the persona can reduce some of these biases and enhance alignment with human choices. While the Chain-of-Thought approach did not improve prediction accuracy, it has potential for AI explainability in the voting process. We also identified a trade-off between preference diversity and alignment accuracy in LLMs, influenced by different temperature settings. Our findings indicate that LLMs may lead to less diverse collective outcomes and biased assumptions when used in voting scenarios, emphasizing the need for cautious integration of LLMs into democratic processes.\n\n\n\n\n\nJ.

Embodied LLM Agents Learn to Cooperate in Organized Teams (arXiv:2403.12482). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.12482\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nLarge Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as integral tools for reasoning, planning, and decision-making, drawing upon their extensive world knowledge and proficiency in language-related tasks. LLMs thus hold tremendous potential for natural language interaction within multi-agent systems to foster cooperation. However, LLM agents tend to over-report and comply with any instruction, which may result in information redundancy and confusion in multi-agent cooperation. Inspired by human organizations, this paper introduces a framework that imposes prompt-based organization structures on LLM agents to mitigate these problems. Through a series of experiments with embodied LLM agents and human-agent collaboration, our results highlight the impact of designated leadership on team efficiency, shedding light on the leadership qualities displayed by LLM agents and their spontaneous cooperative behaviors. Further, we harness the potential of LLMs to propose enhanced organizational prompts, via a Criticize-Reflect process, resulting in novel organization structures that reduce communication costs and enhance team efficiency.\n\n\n\n\n\nGuo et al.

These measures come with analytic weaknesses, such as researcher bias, intra- and inter-rater reliability concerns, and time-consuming coding protocols. A possible solution exists in the latent semantic patterns that exist in machine learning large language models. These semantic patterns could be used to analyze qualitative responses. This exploratory research compared the statistical quality of automated sentence coding using large language models to the benchmarks of self-report and behavioral measures within the context of trust in automation research. The results indicated that three large language models show promise as tools for analyzing qualitative responses. The study also provides insight on minimum sample sizes for model creation and offers recommendations for further validating the robustness of large language models as research tools.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Koehl & Vangsness (2023)\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVats, V., Nizam, M.

A Survey on Human-AI Teaming with Large Pre-Trained Models (arXiv:2403.04931). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04931\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), the collaboration between human intelligence and AI systems, known as Human-AI (HAI) Teaming, has emerged as a cornerstone for advancing problem-solving and decision-making processes. The advent of Large Pre-trained Models (LPtM) has significantly transformed this landscape, offering unprecedented capabilities by leveraging vast amounts of data to understand and predict complex patterns. This paper surveys the pivotal integration of LPtMs with HAI, emphasizing how these models enhance collaborative intelligence beyond traditional approaches. It examines the potential of LPtMs in augmenting human capabilities, discussing this collaboration for AI model improvements, effective teaming, ethical considerations, and their broad applied implications in various sectors. Through this exploration, the study sheds light on the transformative impact of LPtM-enhanced HAI Teaming, providing insights for future research, policy development, and strategic implementations aimed at harnessing the full potential of this collaboration for research and societal benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable from Vats et al.

Japanese Psychological Research. https://doi.org/10.1111/jpr.12552\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThis study investigated the impact of group discussions with text-based conversational agents on risk-taking decision-making, which has been under-researched. We also focused on the influence of opinion patterns presented by the agents during discussions and attitudes toward these agents. Through an online experiment, 430 participants read a decision-seeking scenario and expressed the degree of risk they were willing to take. After viewing the text-based opinions of six agents and having a discussion with the agents, participants expressed the degree of risk they were willing to take for the same scenario. The result showed that participants’ risk-taking decisions shifted toward the agents’ group opinions, regardless of whether the agents’ opinions tended to be risky or cautious. Additionally, when the agents’ group opinions were more risk-biased and included a minority opinion, a significant association existed between the degree of the participants’ shift to a riskier decision and their positive attitudes toward the agents. The agents’ group opinions guided participants toward both risky and cautious decisions, and participants’ attitudes toward the agents were associated with their decision-making, albeit to a limited extent.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Nishida et al.

Extended Abstracts of the CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems, 1–11. https://doi.org/10.1145/3613905.3650786\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nWith ChatGPT’s release, conversational prompting has become the most popular form of human-LLM interaction. However, its effectiveness is limited for more complex tasks involving reasoning, creativity, and iteration. Through a systematic analysis of HCI papers published since 2021, we identified four key phases in the human-LLM interaction flow - planning, facilitating, iterating, and testing - to precisely understand the dynamics of this process. Additionally, we have developed a taxonomy of four primary interaction modes: Mode 1: Standard Prompting, Mode 2: User Interface, Mode 3: Context-based, and Mode 4: Agent Facilitator. This taxonomy was further enriched using the “5W1H” guideline method, which involved a detailed examination of definitions, participant roles (Who), the phases that happened (When), human objectives and LLM abilities (What), and the mechanics of each interaction mode (How). We anticipate this taxonomy will contribute to the future design and evaluation of human-LLM interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5: J. Gao et al.

Proceedings of the ACM on Interactive, Mobile, Wearable and Ubiquitous Technologies, 8(2), 1–35. https://doi.org/10.1145/3659625\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nDespite the plethora of telehealth applications to assist home-based older adults and healthcare providers, basic messaging and phone calls are still the most common communication methods, which suffer from limited availability, information loss, and process inefficiencies. One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs’ role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults’ conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers’ efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs’ capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Z. Yang et al.

Task Allocation in Teams as a Multi-Armed Bandit. https://cocosci.princeton.edu/papers/marjieh2024task.pdf\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nHumans rely on efficient distribution of resources to transcend the abilities of individuals. Successful task allocation, whether in small teams or across large institutions, depends on individuals’ ability to discern their own and others’ strengths and weaknesses, and to optimally act on them. This dependence creates a tension between exploring the capabilities of others and exploiting the knowledge acquired so far, which can be challenging. How do people navigate this tension? To address this question, we propose a novel task allocation paradigm in which a human agent is asked to repeatedly allocate tasks in three distinct classes (categorizing a blurry image, detecting a noisy voice command, and solving an anagram) between themselves and two other (bot) team members to maximize team performance. We show that this problem can be recast as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit which allows us to compare people’s performance against two well-known strategies, Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). We find that humans are able to successfully integrate information about the capabilities of different team members to infer optimal allocations, and in some cases perform on par with these optimal strategies. Our approach opens up new avenues for studying the mechanisms underlying collective cooperation in teams.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Marjieh et al. (2024)",

Conversely, accessing information from human team members is negatively associated with these aspects, regardless of team performance. This study is a valuable contribution to the expanding field of research on human-AI teams and team science in general, as it emphasizes the necessity of incorporating AI agents as knowledge sources in a team’s transactive memory system, as well as highlighting their role as catalysts for speaking up.

Recently, integrating large language models into agent-based modeling and simulation presents a promising avenue for enhancing simulation capabilities. This paper surveys the landscape of utilizing large language models in agent-based modeling and simulation, discussing their challenges and promising future directions.

We then discuss the motivation for applying large language models to agent-based simulation and systematically analyze the challenges in environment perception, human alignment, action generation, and evaluation. Most importantly, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent works of large language model-empowered agent-based modeling and simulation in multiple scenarios, which can be divided into four domains: cyber, physical, social, and hybrid, covering simulation of both real-world and virtual environments, and how these works address the above challenges.

In this Perspective, we show how the science of collaborative cognition can be put to work to engineer systems that really can be called “thought partners,” systems built to meet our expectations and complement our limitations. We lay out several modes of collaborative thought in which humans and AI thought partners can engage and propose desiderata for human-compatible thought partnerships. Drawing on motifs from computational cognitive science, we motivate an alternative scaling path for the design of thought partners and ecosystems around their use through a Bayesian lens, whereby the partners we construct actively build and reason over models of the human and world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Collins et al.

Large Language Models for Collective Problem-Solving: Insights into Group Consensus Decision-Making. https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6s060914\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nLarge Language models (LLM) exhibit human-like proficiency in various tasks such as translation, question answering, essay writing, and programming. Emerging research explores the use of LLMs in collective problem-solving endeavors, such as tasks where groups try to uncover clues through discussions. Although prior work has investigated individual problem-solving tasks, leveraging LLM-powered agents for group consensus and decision-making remains largely unexplored. This research addresses this gap by (1) proposing an algorithm to enable free-form conversation in groups of LLM agents, (2) creating metrics to evaluate the human-likeness of the generated dialogue and problem-solving performance, and (3) evaluating LLM agent groups against human groups using an open source dataset. Our results reveal that LLM groups outperform human groups in problem-solving tasks. LLM groups also show a greater improvement in scores after participating in free discussions. In particular, analyses indicate that LLM agent groups exhibit more disagreements, complex statements, and a propensity for positive statements compared to human groups.

The study examines the synergistic interaction between Human Intelligence (HI) and GAI across four group decision-making scenarios within three global organizations renowned for their cutting-edge operational techniques. The research progresses through several phases: identifying research problems, collecting baseline data on decision-making, implementing AI interventions, and evaluating the outcomes post-intervention to identify shifts in performance. The results demonstrate that GAI effectively reduces human cognitive burdens and mitigates heuristic biases by offering data-driven support and predictive analytics, grounded in System 2 reasoning. This is particularly valuable in complex situations characterized by unfamiliarity and information overload, where intuitive, System 1 thinking is less effective. However, the study also uncovers challenges related to GAI integration, such as potential over-reliance on technology, intrinsic biases particularly ‘out-of-the-box’ thinking without contextual creativity. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative strategic framework for HI-GAI collaboration that emphasizes transparency, accountability, and inclusiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Hao et al.

Here we focus on the unique opportunities and challenges this transformation poses for collective intelligence.

The rise of AI technologies has the potential to provide data-driven insights to facilitate group decision making, although it is found that groups do not always utilize AI assistance appropriately. In this paper, we aim to examine whether and how the introduction of a devil’s advocate in the AI-assisted group deci- sion making processes could help groups better utilize AI assistance and change the perceptions of group processes during decision making. Inspired by the exceptional conversational capabilities ex- hibited by modern large language models (LLMs), we design four different styles of devil’s advocate powered by LLMs, varying their interactivity (i.e., interactive vs. non-interactive) and their target of objection (i.e., challenge the AI recommendation or the majority opinion within the group). Through a randomized human-subject experiment, we find evidence suggesting that LLM-powered devil’s advocates that argue against the AI model’s decision recommenda- tion have the potential to promote groups’ appropriate reliance on AI. Meanwhile, the introduction of LLM-powered devil’s advocate usually does not lead to substantial increases in people’s perceived workload for completing the group decision making tasks, while interactive LLM-powered devil’s advocates are perceived as more collaborating and of higher quality.

The Wisdom of Partisan Crowds: Comparing Collective Intelligence in Humans and LLM-based Agents. https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3k67x8s5\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nHuman groups are able to converge to more accurate beliefs through deliberation, even in the presence of polarization and partisan bias — a phenomenon known as the “wisdom of partisan crowds.” Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to simulate human collective behavior, yet few benchmarks exist for evaluating their dynamics against the behavior of human groups. In this paper, we examine the extent to which the wisdom of partisan crowds emerges in groups of LLM-based agents that are prompted to role-play as partisan personas (e.g., Democrat or Republican). We find that they not only display human-like partisan biases, but also converge to more accurate beliefs through deliberation, as humans do. We then identify several factors that interfere with convergence, including the use of chain-of-thought prompting and lack of details in personas. Conversely, fine-tuning on human data appears to enhance convergence. These findings show the potential and limitations of LLM-based agents as a model of human collective intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\nChuang et al. (2024)",

Language is hypothesized to play a key role in human culture, driving individual cognitive capacities and shaping communication. Yet the majority of models of collective innovation assign no cognitive capacities or language abilities to agents. Here, we contribute a computational study of collective innovation where agents are Large Language Models (LLMs) that play Little Alchemy 2, a creative video game originally developed for humans that, as we argue, captures useful aspects of innovation landscapes not present in previous test-beds. We, first, study an LLM in isolation and discover that it exhibits both useful skills and crucial limitations. We, then, study groups of LLMs that share information related to their behaviour and focus on the effect of social connectivity on collective performance. In agreement with previous human and computational studies, we observe that groups with dynamic connectivity out-compete fully-connected groups. Our work reveals opportunities and challenges for future studies of collective innovation that are becoming increasingly relevant as Generative Artificial Intelligence algorithms and humans innovate alongside each other.\n\n\n\n\n\nNisioti et al.

This paper probes the collaboration mechanisms among contemporary NLP systems by melding practical experiments with theoretical insights. We fabricate four unique ‘societies’ comprised of LLM agents, where each agent is characterized by a specific ‘trait’ (easy-going or overconfident) and engages in collaboration with a distinct ‘thinking pattern’ (debate or reflection). Through evaluating these multi-agent societies on three benchmark datasets, we discern that certain collaborative strategies not only outshine previous top-tier approaches but also optimize efficiency (using fewer API tokens). Moreover, our results further illustrate that LLM agents manifest humanlike social behaviors, such as conformity and consensus reaching, mirroring foundational social psychology theories. In conclusion, we integrate insights from social psychology to contextualize the collaboration of LLM agents, inspiring further investigations into the collaboration mechanism for LLMs. We have shared our code and datasets1, hoping to catalyze further research in this promising avenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nZhang et al.

Yet, we have a limited understanding of LLMs’ reasoning and decision-making capabilities, partly stemming from a lack of dedicated evaluation benchmarks. As negotiating and compromising are key aspects of our everyday communication and collaboration, we propose using scorable negotiation games as a new evaluation framework for LLMs. We create a testbed of diverse text-based, multi-agent, multi-issue, semantically rich negotiation games, with easily tunable difficulty. To solve the challenge, agents need to have strong arithmetic, inference, exploration, and planning capabilities, while seamlessly integrating them. Via a systematic zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT), we show that agents can negotiate and consistently reach successful deals. We quantify the performance with multiple metrics and observe a large gap between GPT-4 and earlier models. Importantly, we test the generalization to new games and setups. Finally, we show that these games can help evaluate other critical aspects, such as the interaction dynamics between agents in the presence of greedy and adversarial players.\n\n\n\n\n\nAbdelnabi et al.

While the Chain-of-Thought approach did not improve prediction accuracy, it has potential for AI explainability in the voting process.

LLMs thus hold tremendous potential for natural language interaction within multi-agent systems to foster cooperation. However, LLM agents tend to over-report and comply with any instruction, which may result in information redundancy and confusion in multi-agent cooperation. Inspired by human organizations, this paper introduces a framework that imposes prompt-based organization structures on LLM agents to mitigate these problems. Through a series of experiments with embodied LLM agents and human-agent collaboration, our results highlight the impact of designated leadership on team efficiency, shedding light on the leadership qualities displayed by LLM agents and their spontaneous cooperative behaviors.

The advent of Large Pre-trained Models (LPtM) has significantly transformed this landscape, offering unprecedented capabilities by leveraging vast amounts of data to understand and predict complex patterns. This paper surveys the pivotal integration of LPtMs with HAI, emphasizing how these models enhance collaborative intelligence beyond traditional approaches. It examines the potential of LPtMs in augmenting human capabilities, discussing this collaboration for AI model improvements, effective teaming, ethical considerations, and their broad applied implications in various sectors. Through this exploration, the study sheds light on the transformative impact of LPtM-enhanced HAI Teaming, providing insights for future research, policy development, and strategic implementations aimed at harnessing the full potential of this collaboration for research and societal benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable from Vats et al.

Proceedings of the ACM on Human-Computer Interaction, 5(CSCW1), 1–21. https://doi.org/10.1145/3449287\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nPeople supported by AI-powered decision support tools frequently overrely on the AI: they accept an AI’s suggestion even when that suggestion is wrong. Adding explanations to the AI decisions does not appear to reduce the overreliance and some studies suggest that it might even increase it. Informed by the dual-process theory of cognition, we posit that people rarely engage analytically with each individual AI recommendation and explanation, and instead develop general heuristics about whether and when to follow the AI suggestions. Building on prior research on medical decision-making, we designed three cognitive forcing interventions to compel people to engage more thoughtfully with the AI-generated explanations. We conducted an experiment (N=199), in which we compared our three cognitive forcing designs to two simple explainable AI approaches and to a no-AI baseline. The results demonstrate that cognitive forcing significantly reduced overreliance compared to the simple explainable AI approaches. However, there was a trade-off: people assigned the least favorable subjective ratings to the designs that reduced the overreliance the most. To audit our work for intervention-generated inequalities, we investigated whether our interventions benefited equally people with different levels of Need for Cognition (i.e., motivation to engage in effortful mental activities). Our results show that, on average, cognitive forcing interventions benefited participants higher in Need for Cognition more. Our research suggests that human cognitive motivation moderates the effectiveness of explainable AI solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Buçinca et al. (2021)",

The result showed that participants’ risk-taking decisions shifted toward the agents’ group opinions, regardless of whether the agents’ opinions tended to be risky or cautious. Additionally, when the agents’ group opinions were more risk-biased and included a minority opinion, a significant association existed between the degree of the participants’ shift to a riskier decision and their positive attitudes toward the agents.

Current literature focusses on how users interact with AI assistance when there is no time pressure, finding that different AI assistances have different benefits: some can reduce time taken while increasing overreliance on AI, while others do the opposite. The precise benefit can depend on both the user and task. In time-pressured scenarios, adapting when we show AI assistance is especially important: relying on the AI assistance can save time, and can therefore be beneficial when the AI is likely to be right. We would ideally adapt what AI assistance we show depending on various properties (of the task and of the user) in order to best trade off accuracy and time. We introduce a study where users have to answer a series of logic puzzles. We find that time pressure affects how users use different AI assistances, making some assistances more beneficial than others when compared to notime-pressure settings. We also find that a user’s overreliance rate is a key predictor of their behaviour: overreliers and not-overreliers use different AI assistance types differently. We find marginal correlations between a user’s overreliance rate (which is related to the user’s trust in AI recommendations) and their personality traits (Big Five Personality traits). Overall, our work suggests that AI assistances have different accuracy-time tradeoffs when people are under time pressure compared to no time pressure, and we explore how we might adapt AI assistances in this setting.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Swaroop et al.

In such a paradigm, humans are found to rarely trigger analytical thinking and face difficulties in communicating the nuances of conflicting opinions to the AI when disagreements occur. To tackle this challenge, we propose Human-AI Deliberation, a novel framework to promote human reflection and discussion on conflicting human-AI opinions in decision-making. Based on theories in human deliberation, this framework engages humans and AI in dimension-level opinion elicitation, deliberative discussion, and decision updates. To empower AI with deliberative capabilities, we designed Deliberative AI, which leverages large language models (LLMs) as a bridge between humans and domain-specific models to enable flexible conversational interactions and faithful information provision. An exploratory evaluation on a graduate admissions task shows that Deliberative AI outperforms conventional explainable AI (XAI) assistants in improving humans’ appropriate reliance and task performance. Based on a mixed-methods analysis of participant behavior, perception, user experience, and open-ended feedback, we draw implications for future AI-assisted decision tool design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Figure from Ma et al.

Current systems fail to understand these under-specified commands since they cannot reason about devices and settings as they relate to human situations. We introduce large language models (LLMs) to this problem space, exploring their use for controlling devices and creating automation routines in response to under-specified user commands in smart homes. We empirically study the baseline quality and failure modes of LLM-created action plans with a survey of age-diverse users. We find that LLMs can reason creatively to achieve challenging goals, but they experience patterns of failure that diminish their usefulness. We address these gaps with Sasha, a smarter smart home assistant. Sasha responds to loosely-constrained commands like “make it cozy” or “help me sleep better” by executing plans to achieve user goals—e.g., setting a mood with available devices, or devising automation routines. We implement and evaluate Sasha in a hands-on user study, showing the capabilities and limitations of LLM-driven smart homes when faced with unconstrained user-generated scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figure from King, Yu, Lee, et al.

New digital systems mixed with engaging and gamification mechanisms could play an important role in achieving such an objective. In particular, Conversational Agents, like Smart Home Assistants, are a promising tool that encourage sustainable behaviors within household settings. In recent years, large language models (LLMs) have shown great potential in enhancing the capabilities of such assistants, making them more effective in interacting with users. We present the design and implementation of GreenIFTTT, an application empowered by GPT4 to create and control home automation routines. The agent helps users understand which energy consumption optimization routines could be created and applied to make their home appliances more environmentally sustainable. We performed an exploratory study (Italy, December 2023) with N = 13 participants to test our application’s usability and UX. The results suggest that GreenIFTTT is a usable, engaging, easy, and supportive tool, providing insight into new perspectives and usage of LLMs to create more environmentally sustainable home automation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Giudici et al.

Save It for the “Hot” Day: An LLM-Empowered Visual Analytics System for Heat Risk Management (arXiv:2406.03317). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.03317\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe escalating frequency and intensity of heat-related climate events, particularly heatwaves, emphasize the pressing need for advanced heat risk management strategies. Current approaches, primarily relying on numerical models, face challenges in spatial-temporal resolution and in capturing the dynamic interplay of environmental, social, and behavioral factors affecting heat risks. This has led to difficulties in translating risk assessments into effective mitigation actions. Recognizing these problems, we introduce a novel approach leveraging the burgeoning capabilities of Large Language Models (LLMs) to extract rich and contextual insights from news reports. We hence propose an LLM-empowered visual analytics system, Havior, that integrates the precise, data-driven insights of numerical models with nuanced news report information. This hybrid approach enables a more comprehensive assessment of heat risks and better identification, assessment, and mitigation of heat-related threats. The system incorporates novel visualization designs, such as “thermoglyph” and news glyph, enhancing intuitive understanding and analysis of heat risks. The integration of LLM-based techniques also enables advanced information retrieval and semantic knowledge extraction that can be guided by experts’ analytics needs. Our case studies on two cities that faced significant heatwave events and interviews with five experts have demonstrated the usefulness of our system in providing in-depth and actionable insights for heat risk management.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Li et al.

An LLM-Based Digital Twin for Optimizing Human-in-the Loop Systems (arXiv:2403.16809). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16809\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe increasing prevalence of Cyber-Physical Systems and the Internet of Things (CPS-IoT) applications and Foundation Models are enabling new applications that leverage real-time control of the environment. For example, real-time control of Heating, Ventilation and Air-Conditioning (HVAC) systems can reduce its usage when not needed for the comfort of human occupants, hence reducing energy consumption. Collecting realtime feedback on human preferences in such human-in-the-loop (HITL) systems, however, is difficult in practice. We propose the use of large language models (LLMs) to deal with the challenges of dynamic environments and difficult-to-obtain data in CPS optimization. In this paper, we present a case study that employs LLM agents to mimic the behaviors and thermal preferences of various population groups (e.g. young families, the elderly) in a shopping mall. The aggregated thermal preferences are integrated into an agent-in-the-loop based reinforcement learning algorithm AitL-RL, which employs the LLM as a dynamic simulation of the physical environment to learn how to balance between energy savings and occupant comfort. Our results show that LLMs are capable of simulating complex population movements within large open spaces. Besides, AitL-RLdemonstrates superior performance compared to the popular existing policy of set point control, suggesting that adaptive and personalized decision-making is critical for efficient optimization in CPS-IoT applications. Through this case study, we demonstrate the potential of integrating advanced Foundation Models like LLMs into CPS-IoT to enhance system adaptability and efficiency.

However, it is still unknown whether state-of-the-art LLMs master sufficient knowledge related to heating, ventilation and air conditioning (HVAC) systems. It will be inspiring if LLMs can think and learn like professionals in the HVAC industry. Hence, this study investigates the performance of LLMs on mastering the knowledge and skills related to the HVAC industry by letting them take the ASHRAE Certified HVAC Designer examination, an authoritative examination in the HVAC industry. Three key knowledge capabilities are explored: recall, analysis and application. Twelve representative LLMs are tested such as GPT-3.5, GPT-4 and LLaMA. According to the results, GPT-4 passes the ASHRAE Certified HVAC Designer examination with scores from 74 to 78, which is higher than about half of human examinees. Besides, GPT-3.5 passes the examination twice out of five times. It demonstrates that some LLMs such as GPT-4 and GPT-3.5 have great potential to assist or replace humans in designing and operating HVAC systems. However, they still make some mistakes sometimes due to the lack of knowledge, poor reasoning capabilities and unsatisfactory equation calculation abilities. Accordingly, four future research directions are proposed to reveal how to utilize and improve LLMs in the HVAC industry: teaching LLMs to use design tools or software in the HVAC industry, enabling LLMs to read and analyze the operational data from HVAC systems, developing tailored corpuses for the HVAC industry, and assessing the performance of LLMs in real-world HVAC design and operation scenarios.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Lu et al.

However, the fault diagnosis accuracy of LLMs is still unsatisfactory, due to the lack of effective diagnosis accuracy enhancement methods for LLMs. To fill this gap, this study proposes a LLM fine-tuning method supervised by data with fault and fault-free labels to enhance the fault diagnosis accuracy of LLMs. This method designs a LLM self-correction strategy to automatically generate a fine-tuning dataset based on the labeled data. The generated fine-tuning dataset is applied to fine-tune a LLM. Moreover, a data augmentation-based approach is put forward to adaptively update the fine-tuning dataset for iteratively developing a high-performance fine-tuned LLM. The proposed method is utilized to fine-tune the GPT-3.5 model using the air handling unit (AHU) fault dataset from the RP-1312 project. The results show that the diagnosis accuracy of the GPT-3.5 model is increased from 29.5 % to 100.0 % after model fine-tuning. Compared with the GPT-4 model, the fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model achieves a 31.1 % higher average diagnosis accuracy. The fine-tuned GPT-3.5 model is also applied to diagnose faults in two AHUs from another open-source dataset to verify the generalization ability of this model. The two AHUs have different system structures and sensor configurations compared to the AHU in the RP-1312 dataset, and this dataset is not utilized to fine-tune the GPT-3.5 model. The average diagnosis accuracy of the GPT-3.5 model is increased from 46.0 % to 99.1 % and from 38.8 % to 98.9 % for the faults in the two AHUs, respectively, after model fine-tuning. Furthermore, the proposed method is verified using two fault datasets from a variable air volume box and a chiller plant system. After fine-tuning the GPT-3.5 model using the two datasets, the average diagnosis accuracy of this model is increased from 33.0 % to 98.3 % for variable air volume box faults and from 36.0 % to 99.1 % for chiller plant system faults.

When AI agents with ToM capability collaborate with humans, Mutual Theory of Mind (MToM) arises in such human-AI teams (HATs). The MToM process, which involves interactive communication and ToM-based strategy adjustment, affects the team’s performance and collaboration process. To explore the MToM process, we conducted a mixed-design experiment using a large language model-driven AI agent with ToM and communication modules in a real-time shared-workspace task. We find that the agent’s ToM capability does not significantly impact team performance but enhances human understanding of the agent and the feeling of being understood. Most participants in our study believe verbal communication increases human burden, and the results show that bidirectional communication leads to lower HAT performance. We discuss the results’ implications for designing AI agents that collaborate with humans in real-time shared workspace tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Zhang et al. (2024)",

Through a systematic analysis of HCI papers published since 2021, we identified four key phases in the human-LLM interaction flow - planning, facilitating, iterating, and testing - to precisely understand the dynamics of this process. Additionally, we have developed a taxonomy of four primary interaction modes: Mode 1: Standard Prompting, Mode 2: User Interface, Mode 3: Context-based, and Mode 4: Agent Facilitator. This taxonomy was further enriched using the “5W1H” guideline method, which involved a detailed examination of definitions, participant roles (Who), the phases that happened (When), human objectives and LLM abilities (What), and the mechanics of each interaction mode (How).

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs’ role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults’ conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers’ efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs’ capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Z. Yang et al.

However, in the scenario of smart homes, where activities are of varying duration and frequency, the assumption of a constant sized window does not hold. Additionally, previous works have shown these activities to be made up of building blocks. We focus on identifying these underlying building blocks–structural constructs, with the use of large language models. Identifying these constructs can be beneficial especially in recognizing short-duration and infrequent activities, which current systems cannot recognize. We also propose the development of an activity recognition procedure that uses these building blocks to model activities, thus helping the downstream task of activity monitoring in smart homes.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Hiremath & Plötz (2024)",

Thoughtful Things: Building Human-Centric Smart Devices with Small Language Models (arXiv:2405.03821). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2405.03821\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nEveryday devices like light bulbs and kitchen appliances are now embedded with so many features and automated behaviors that they have become complicated to actually use. While such “smart” capabilities can better support users’ goals, the task of learning the “ins and outs” of different devices is daunting. Voice assistants aim to solve this problem by providing a natural language interface to devices, yet such assistants cannot understand loosely-constrained commands, they lack the ability to reason about and explain devices’ behaviors to users, and they rely on connectivity to intrusive cloud infrastructure. Toward addressing these issues, we propose thoughtful things: devices that leverage lightweight, on-device language models to take actions and explain their behaviors in response to unconstrained user commands. We propose an end-to-end framework that leverages formal modeling, automated training data synthesis, and generative language models to create devices that are both capable and thoughtful in the presence of unconstrained user goals and inquiries. Our framework requires no labeled data and can be deployed on-device, with no cloud dependency. We implement two thoughtful things (a lamp and a thermostat) and deploy them on real hardware, evaluating their practical performance.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Figure from King, Yu, Vartak, et al.

These agents must retrieve and provide consistent, accurate, and relevant information to address user’s queries and needs. Yet such agents generate unfounded responses (“hallucinate”). Traditional dialogue trees can only handle a limited number of conversation flows, making them inherently brittle. To this end, we present KITA - a programmable framework for creating task-oriented conversational agents that are designed to handle complex user interactions. Unlike LLMs, KITA provides reliable grounded responses, with controllable agent policies through its expressive specification, KITA Worksheet. In contrast to dialog trees, it is resilient to diverse user queries, helpful with knowledge sources, and offers ease of programming policies through its declarative paradigm. Through a real-user study involving 62 participants, we show that KITA beats the GPT-4 with function calling baseline by 26.1, 22.5, and 52.4 points on execution accuracy, dialogue act accuracy, and goal completion rate, respectively. We also release 22 real-user conversations with KITA manually corrected to ensure accuracy.\n\n\nJoshi et al. (2024)",

Large Language Models are Zero-Shot Recognizers for Activities of Daily Living (arXiv:2407.01238). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.01238\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThe sensor-based recognition of Activities of Daily Living (ADLs) in smart home environments enables several applications in the areas of energy management, safety, well-being, and healthcare. ADLs recognition is typically based on deep learning methods requiring large datasets to be trained. Recently, several studies proved that Large Language Models (LLMs) effectively capture common-sense knowledge about human activities. However, the effectiveness of LLMs for ADLs recognition in smart home environments still deserves to be investigated. In this work, we propose ADL-LLM, a novel LLM-based ADLs recognition system. ADLLLM transforms raw sensor data into textual representations, that are processed by an LLM to perform zero-shot ADLs recognition. Moreover, in the scenario where a small labeled dataset is available, ADL-LLM can also be empowered with few-shot prompting. We evaluated ADL-LLM on two public datasets, showing its effectiveness in this domain.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Figures from Civitarese et al. (2024)",

(2024). Large Language Models for Power Scheduling: A User-Centric Approach (arXiv:2407.00476). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.00476\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nWhile traditional optimization and scheduling schemes are designed to meet fixed, predefined system requirements, future systems are moving toward user-driven approaches and personalized services, aiming to achieve high quality-of-experience (QoE) and flexibility. This challenge is particularly pronounced in wireless and digitalized energy networks, where users’ requirements have largely not been taken into consideration due to the lack of a common language between users and machines. The emergence of powerful large language models (LLMs) marks a radical departure from traditional system-centric methods into more advanced user-centric approaches by providing a natural communication interface between users and devices. In this paper, for the first time, we introduce a novel architecture for resource scheduling problems by constructing three LLM agents to convert an arbitrary user’s voice request (VRQ) into a resource allocation vector. Specifically, we design an LLM intent recognition agent to translate the request into an optimization problem (OP), an LLM OP parameter identification agent, and an LLM OP solving agent. To evaluate system performance, we construct a database of typical VRQs in the context of electric vehicle (EV) charging. As a proof of concept, we primarily use Llama 3 8B. Through testing with different prompt engineering scenarios, the obtained results demonstrate the efficiency of the proposed architecture. The conducted performance analysis allows key insights to be extracted. For instance, having a larger set of candidate OPs to model the real-world problem might degrade the final performance because of a higher recognition/OP classification noise level.

Homeowners, now acting as prosumers, have access to detailed information at 15-min or even 5-min intervals, including weather forecasts, outputs from renewable energy source (RES)-based systems, appliance schedules and the current energy balance, which details any deficits or surpluses along with their quantities and the predicted prices on the local energy market (LEM). The goal for these prosumers is to reduce costs while ensuring their home’s comfort levels are maintained. However, given the complexity and the rapid decision-making required in managing this information, the need for a supportive system is evident. This is particularly true given the routine nature of these decisions, highlighting the potential for a system that provides personalized recommendations to optimize energy consumption, whether that involves adjusting the load or engaging in transactions with the LEM. In this context, we propose a recommendation system powered by large language models (LLMs), Scikit-llm and zero-shot classifiers, designed to evaluate specific scenarios and offer tailored advice for prosumers based on the available data at any given moment. Two scenarios for a prosumer of 5.9 kW are assessed using candidate labels, such as Decrease, Increase, Sell and Buy. A comparison with a content-based filtering system is provided considering the performance metrics that are relevant for prosumers.\n\n\nOprea & Bâra (2024)",

We focus on customizable optimization problems that necessitate repeated solving with slight variations in modeling and are user-specific, hence posing a challenge to devising a one-size-fits-all model. We put forward a strategy that augments an LLM with an optimization solver, enhancing its proficiency in understanding and responding to user specifications and preferences while providing nonlinear reasoning capabilities. Our approach pioneers the novel concept of human-guided optimization autoformalism, translating a natural language task specification automatically into an optimization instance. This enables LLMs to analyze, explain, and tackle a variety of instance-specific energy-related problems, pushing beyond the limits of current prompt-based techniques. Our research encompasses various commonplace tasks in the energy sector, from electric vehicle charging and Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) control to long-term planning problems such as cost-benefit evaluations for installing rooftop solar photovoltaics (PVs) or heat pumps. This pilot study marks an essential stride towards the context-based formulation of optimization using LLMs, with the potential to democratize optimization processes.

Successful task allocation, whether in small teams or across large institutions, depends on individuals’ ability to discern their own and others’ strengths and weaknesses, and to optimally act on them. This dependence creates a tension between exploring the capabilities of others and exploiting the knowledge acquired so far, which can be challenging. How do people navigate this tension? To address this question, we propose a novel task allocation paradigm in which a human agent is asked to repeatedly allocate tasks in three distinct classes (categorizing a blurry image, detecting a noisy voice command, and solving an anagram) between themselves and two other (bot) team members to maximize team performance. We show that this problem can be recast as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit which allows us to compare people’s performance against two well-known strategies, Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). We find that humans are able to successfully integrate information about the capabilities of different team members to infer optimal allocations, and in some cases perform on par with these optimal strategies.

Our findings indicate that interactions with AI agents differ significantly from human interactions, as accessing information from AI agents is positively linked to a team’s ability to generate novel hypotheses and demonstrate speaking-up behavior, but only in higher-performing teams. Conversely, accessing information from human team members is negatively associated with these aspects, regardless of team performance. This study is a valuable contribution to the expanding field of research on human-AI teams and team science in general, as it emphasizes the necessity of incorporating AI agents as knowledge sources in a team’s transactive memory system, as well as highlighting their role as catalysts for speaking up.

Recently, integrating large language models into agent-based modeling and simulation presents a promising avenue for enhancing simulation capabilities. This paper surveys the landscape of utilizing large language models in agent-based modeling and simulation, discussing their challenges and promising future directions. In this survey, since this is an interdisciplinary field, we first introduce the background of agent-based modeling and simulation and large language model-empowered agents. We then discuss the motivation for applying large language models to agent-based simulation and systematically analyze the challenges in environment perception, human alignment, action generation, and evaluation. Most importantly, we provide a comprehensive overview of the recent works of large language model-empowered agent-based modeling and simulation in multiple scenarios, which can be divided into four domains: cyber, physical, social, and hybrid, covering simulation of both real-world and virtual environments, and how these works address the above challenges. Finally, since this area is new and quickly evolving, we discuss the open problems and promising future directions. We summarize the representative papers along with their code repositories in https://github.com/tsinghua-fib-lab/LLM-Agent-Based-Modeling-and-Simulation.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from C. Gao et al. (2024)",

We envision machines that are not just tools for thought, but partners in thought: reasonable, insightful, knowledgeable, reliable, and trustworthy systems that think with us. Current artificial intelligence (AI) systems satisfy some of these criteria, some of the time. In this Perspective, we show how the science of collaborative cognition can be put to work to engineer systems that really can be called “thought partners,” systems built to meet our expectations and complement our limitations. We lay out several modes of collaborative thought in which humans and AI thought partners can engage and propose desiderata for human-compatible thought partnerships. Drawing on motifs from computational cognitive science, we motivate an alternative scaling path for the design of thought partners and ecosystems around their use through a Bayesian lens, whereby the partners we construct actively build and reason over models of the human and world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Collins et al.

Emerging research explores the use of LLMs in collective problem-solving endeavors, such as tasks where groups try to uncover clues through discussions. Although prior work has investigated individual problem-solving tasks, leveraging LLM-powered agents for group consensus and decision-making remains largely unexplored. This research addresses this gap by (1) proposing an algorithm to enable free-form conversation in groups of LLM agents, (2) creating metrics to evaluate the human-likeness of the generated dialogue and problem-solving performance, and (3) evaluating LLM agent groups against human groups using an open source dataset. Our results reveal that LLM groups outperform human groups in problem-solving tasks. LLM groups also show a greater improvement in scores after participating in free discussions. In particular, analyses indicate that LLM agent groups exhibit more disagreements, complex statements, and a propensity for positive statements compared to human groups. The results shed light on the potential of LLMs to facilitate collective reasoning and provide insight into the dynamics of group interactions involving synthetic LLM agents.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Figure from Du et al.

The study examines the synergistic interaction between Human Intelligence (HI) and GAI across four group decision-making scenarios within three global organizations renowned for their cutting-edge operational techniques. The research progresses through several phases: identifying research problems, collecting baseline data on decision-making, implementing AI interventions, and evaluating the outcomes post-intervention to identify shifts in performance. The results demonstrate that GAI effectively reduces human cognitive burdens and mitigates heuristic biases by offering data-driven support and predictive analytics, grounded in System 2 reasoning. This is particularly valuable in complex situations characterized by unfamiliarity and information overload, where intuitive, System 1 thinking is less effective. However, the study also uncovers challenges related to GAI integration, such as potential over-reliance on technology, intrinsic biases particularly ‘out-of-the-box’ thinking without contextual creativity. To address these issues, this paper proposes an innovative strategic framework for HI-GAI collaboration that emphasizes transparency, accountability, and inclusiveness.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Hao et al.

Through distributed cognition and coordination, collectives can achieve outcomes that exceed the capabilities of individuals—even experts—resulting in improved accuracy and novel capabilities.

Large language models, however, are transforming how information is aggregated, accessed and transmitted online. Here we focus on the unique opportunities and challenges this transformation poses for collective intelligence. We bring together interdisciplinary perspectives from industry and academia to identify potential benefits, risks, policy-relevant considerations and open research questions, culminating in a call for a closer examination of how large language models affect humans’ ability to collectively tackle complex problems.\n\n\n\n\n\nBurton et al.

In such a paradigm, humans are found to rarely trigger analytical thinking and face difficulties in communicating the nuances of conflicting opinions to the AI when disagreements occur. To tackle this challenge, we propose Human-AI Deliberation, a novel framework to promote human reflection and discussion on conflicting human-AI opinions in decision-making. Based on theories in human deliberation, this framework engages humans and AI in dimension-level opinion elicitation, deliberative discussion, and decision updates. To empower AI with deliberative capabilities, we designed Deliberative AI, which leverages large language models (LLMs) as a bridge between humans and domain-specific models to enable flexible conversational interactions and faithful information provision. An exploratory evaluation on a graduate admissions task shows that Deliberative AI outperforms conventional explainable AI (XAI) assistants in improving humans’ appropriate reliance and task performance. Based on a mixed-methods analysis of participant behavior, perception, user experience, and open-ended feedback, we draw implications for future AI-assisted decision tool design.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Figure from Ma et al.

The rise of AI technologies has the potential to provide data-driven insights to facilitate group decision making, although it is found that groups do not always utilize AI assistance appropriately. In this paper, we aim to examine whether and how the introduction of a devil’s advocate in the AI-assisted group deci- sion making processes could help groups better utilize AI assistance and change the perceptions of group processes during decision making. Inspired by the exceptional conversational capabilities ex- hibited by modern large language models (LLMs), we design four different styles of devil’s advocate powered by LLMs, varying their interactivity (i.e., interactive vs. non-interactive) and their target of objection (i.e., challenge the AI recommendation or the majority opinion within the group). Through a randomized human-subject experiment, we find evidence suggesting that LLM-powered devil’s advocates that argue against the AI model’s decision recommenda- tion have the potential to promote groups’ appropriate reliance on AI. Meanwhile, the introduction of LLM-powered devil’s advocate usually does not lead to substantial increases in people’s perceived workload for completing the group decision making tasks, while interactive LLM-powered devil’s advocates are perceived as more collaborating and of higher quality. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of our findings.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Chiang et al. (2024)",

In this paper, we examine the extent to which the wisdom of partisan crowds emerges in groups of LLM-based agents that are prompted to role-play as partisan personas (e.g., Democrat or Republican). We find that they not only display human-like partisan biases, but also converge to more accurate beliefs through deliberation, as humans do. We then identify several factors that interfere with convergence, including the use of chain-of-thought prompting and lack of details in personas. Conversely, fine-tuning on human data appears to enhance convergence. These findings show the potential and limitations of LLM-based agents as a model of human collective intelligence.\n\n\n\n\n\nChuang et al. (2024)",

We, first, study an LLM in isolation and discover that it exhibits both useful skills and crucial limitations. We, then, study groups of LLMs that share information related to their behaviour and focus on the effect of social connectivity on collective performance. In agreement with previous human and computational studies, we observe that groups with dynamic connectivity out-compete fully-connected groups. Our work reveals opportunities and challenges for future studies of collective innovation that are becoming increasingly relevant as Generative Artificial Intelligence algorithms and humans innovate alongside each other.\n\n\n\n\n\nNisioti et al.

This paper probes the collaboration mechanisms among contemporary NLP systems by melding practical experiments with theoretical insights. We fabricate four unique ‘societies’ comprised of LLM agents, where each agent is characterized by a specific ‘trait’ (easy-going or overconfident) and engages in collaboration with a distinct ‘thinking pattern’ (debate or reflection). Through evaluating these multi-agent societies on three benchmark datasets, we discern that certain collaborative strategies not only outshine previous top-tier approaches but also optimize efficiency (using fewer API tokens). Moreover, our results further illustrate that LLM agents manifest humanlike social behaviors, such as conformity and consensus reaching, mirroring foundational social psychology theories. In conclusion, we integrate insights from social psychology to contextualize the collaboration of LLM agents, inspiring further investigations into the collaboration mechanism for LLMs. We have shared our code and datasets1, hoping to catalyze further research in this promising avenue.\n\n\n\n\n\nZhang et al.

Yet, we have a limited understanding of LLMs’ reasoning and decision-making capabilities, partly stemming from a lack of dedicated evaluation benchmarks.

To solve the challenge, agents need to have strong arithmetic, inference, exploration, and planning capabilities, while seamlessly integrating them. Via a systematic zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT), we show that agents can negotiate and consistently reach successful deals. We quantify the performance with multiple metrics and observe a large gap between GPT-4 and earlier models. Importantly, we test the generalization to new games and setups.

A Survey on Human-AI Teaming with Large Pre-Trained Models (arXiv:2403.04931). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.04931\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nIn the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), the collaboration between human intelligence and AI systems, known as Human-AI (HAI) Teaming, has emerged as a cornerstone for advancing problem-solving and decision-making processes. The advent of Large Pre-trained Models (LPtM) has significantly transformed this landscape, offering unprecedented capabilities by leveraging vast amounts of data to understand and predict complex patterns. This paper surveys the pivotal integration of LPtMs with HAI, emphasizing how these models enhance collaborative intelligence beyond traditional approaches. It examines the potential of LPtMs in augmenting human capabilities, discussing this collaboration for AI model improvements, effective teaming, ethical considerations, and their broad applied implications in various sectors. Through this exploration, the study sheds light on the transformative impact of LPtM-enhanced HAI Teaming, providing insights for future research, policy development, and strategic implementations aimed at harnessing the full potential of this collaboration for research and societal benefit.\n\n\n\n\n\nTable from Vats et al.

We also focused on the influence of opinion patterns presented by the agents during discussions and attitudes toward these agents. Through an online experiment, 430 participants read a decision-seeking scenario and expressed the degree of risk they were willing to take. After viewing the text-based opinions of six agents and having a discussion with the agents, participants expressed the degree of risk they were willing to take for the same scenario. The result showed that participants’ risk-taking decisions shifted toward the agents’ group opinions, regardless of whether the agents’ opinions tended to be risky or cautious. Additionally, when the agents’ group opinions were more risk-biased and included a minority opinion, a significant association existed between the degree of the participants’ shift to a riskier decision and their positive attitudes toward the agents. The agents’ group opinions guided participants toward both risky and cautious decisions, and participants’ attitudes toward the agents were associated with their decision-making, albeit to a limited extent.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Nishida et al.

However, its effectiveness is limited for more complex tasks involving reasoning, creativity, and iteration. Through a systematic analysis of HCI papers published since 2021, we identified four key phases in the human-LLM interaction flow - planning, facilitating, iterating, and testing - to precisely understand the dynamics of this process. Additionally, we have developed a taxonomy of four primary interaction modes: Mode 1: Standard Prompting, Mode 2: User Interface, Mode 3: Context-based, and Mode 4: Agent Facilitator. This taxonomy was further enriched using the “5W1H” guideline method, which involved a detailed examination of definitions, participant roles (Who), the phases that happened (When), human objectives and LLM abilities (What), and the mechanics of each interaction mode (How). We anticipate this taxonomy will contribute to the future design and evaluation of human-LLM interaction.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: J. Gao et al. (2024)",

One promising solution to facilitate patient-provider communication is to leverage large language models (LLMs) with their powerful natural conversation and summarization capability. However, there is a limited understanding of LLMs’ role during the communication. We first conducted two interview studies with both older adults (N=10) and healthcare providers (N=9) to understand their needs and opportunities for LLMs in patient-provider asynchronous communication. Based on the insights, we built an LLM-powered communication system, Talk2Care, and designed interactive components for both groups: (1) For older adults, we leveraged the convenience and accessibility of voice assistants (VAs) and built an LLM-powered conversational interface for effective information collection. (2) For health providers, we built an LLM-based dashboard to summarize and present important health information based on older adults’ conversations with the VA. We further conducted two user studies with older adults and providers to evaluate the usability of the system. The results showed that Talk2Care could facilitate the communication process, enrich the health information collected from older adults, and considerably save providers’ efforts and time. We envision our work as an initial exploration of LLMs’ capability in the intersection of healthcare and interpersonal communication.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Z.

Adding explanations to the AI decisions does not appear to reduce the overreliance and some studies suggest that it might even increase it. Informed by the dual-process theory of cognition, we posit that people rarely engage analytically with each individual AI recommendation and explanation, and instead develop general heuristics about whether and when to follow the AI suggestions. Building on prior research on medical decision-making, we designed three cognitive forcing interventions to compel people to engage more thoughtfully with the AI-generated explanations. We conducted an experiment (N=199), in which we compared our three cognitive forcing designs to two simple explainable AI approaches and to a no-AI baseline. The results demonstrate that cognitive forcing significantly reduced overreliance compared to the simple explainable AI approaches. However, there was a trade-off: people assigned the least favorable subjective ratings to the designs that reduced the overreliance the most. To audit our work for intervention-generated inequalities, we investigated whether our interventions benefited equally people with different levels of Need for Cognition (i.e., motivation to engage in effortful mental activities). Our results show that, on average, cognitive forcing interventions benefited participants higher in Need for Cognition more. Our research suggests that human cognitive motivation moderates the effectiveness of explainable AI solutions.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Buçinca et al. (2021)",

LLMs have been shown to contain human biases due to the data they have been trained on; whether this is reflected in rational reasoning remains less clear. In this paper, we answer this question by evaluating seven language models using tasks from the cognitive psychology literature. We find that, like humans, LLMs display irrationality in these tasks. However, the way this irrationality is displayed does not reflect that shown by humans. When incorrect answers are given by LLMs to these tasks, they are often incorrect in ways that differ from human-like biases. On top of this, the LLMs reveal an additional layer of irrationality in the significant inconsistency of the responses. Aside from the experimental results, this paper seeks to make a methodological contribution by showing how we can assess and compare different capabilities of these types of models, in this case with respect to rational reasoning.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Figures from Macmillan-Scott & Musolesi (2024)",

Psychologists currently answer such questions with psychometric methods, which analyze correlations across participant responses in survey data sets. In this article, we analyze the preferences that give rise to these correlations. Our approach uses (a) large language models (LLMs) to quantify everyday risky behaviors in terms of the attributes or reasons that may describe those behaviors, and (b) decision models to map these attributes and reasons onto participant responses. We show that LLM-based decision models can explain observed correlations between behaviors in terms of the reasons different behaviors elicit and explain observed correlations between individuals in terms of the weights different individuals place on reasons, thereby providing a decision theoretic foundation for psychometric findings. Since LLMs can generate quantitative representations for nearly any naturalistic decision, they can be used to make accurate out-of-sample predictions for hundreds of everyday behaviors, predict the reasons why people may or may not want to engage in these behaviors, and interpret these reasons in terms of core psychological constructs. Our approach has important theoretical and practical implications for the study of heterogeneity in everyday behavior.\n\n\nBhatia (2024)",

However, people’s perception and understanding are often distorted by their cognitive biases, such as confirmation bias, anchoring bias, availability bias, to name a few. In this work, we use knowledge from the field of cognitive science to account for cognitive biases in the human-AI collaborative decision-making setting, and mitigate their negative effects on collaborative performance. To this end, we mathematically model cognitive biases and provide a general framework through which researchers and practitioners can understand the interplay between cognitive biases and human-AI accuracy. We then focus specifically on anchoring bias, a bias commonly encountered in human-AI collaboration. We implement a time-based de-anchoring strategy and conduct our first user experiment that validates its effectiveness in human-AI collaborative decision-making. With this result, we design a time allocation strategy for a resource-constrained setting that achieves optimal human-AI collaboration under some assumptions. We, then, conduct a second user experiment which shows that our time allocation strategy with explanation can effectively de-anchor the human and improve collaborative performance when the AI model has low confidence and is incorrect.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Figures from Rastogi et al.

Still, it is often ineffective; impaired perceptions – such as low trust or limited understanding – reduce compliance with recommendations provided by the AI system. Drawing from cognitive load theory, we examine two techniques of human-AI collaboration as potential remedies. In three experimental studies, we grant users decision control by empowering them to adjust the system’s recommendations, and we offer explanations for the system’s reasoning. We find decision control positively affects user perceptions of trust and understanding, and improves user compliance with system recommendations. Next, we isolate different effects of providing explanations that may help explain inconsistent findings in recent literature: while explanations help reenact the system’s reasoning, they also increase task complexity. Further, the effectiveness of providing an explanation depends on the specific user’s cognitive ability to handle complex tasks. In summary, our study shows that users benefit from enhanced decision control, while explanations – unless appropriately designed for the specific user – may even harm user perceptions and compliance. This work bears both theoretical and practical implications for the management of human-AI collaboration.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Westphal et al. (2023)",

The question of whether Artificial Intelligence (AI) can possess emotions remains elusive, chiefly due to the absence of an operationalized consensus on what constitutes ‘emotion’ within AI. Adopting a pragmatic approach, this study investigated the response patterns of AI chatbots—specifically, large language models (LLMs)—to various emotional primes. We engaged AI chatbots as one would human participants, presenting scenarios designed to elicit positive, negative, or neutral emotional states. Multiple accounts of OpenAI’s ChatGPT Plus were then tasked with responding to inquiries concerning investment decisions and prosocial behaviors. Our analysis revealed that ChatGPT-4 bots, when primed with positive, negative, or neutral emotions, exhibited distinct response patterns in both risk-taking and prosocial decisions, a phenomenon less evident in the ChatGPT-3.5 iterations. This observation suggests an enhanced capacity for modulating responses based on emotional cues in more advanced LLMs. While these findings do not suggest the presence of emotions in AI, they underline the feasibility of swaying AI responses by leveraging emotional indicators.\n\n\n\n\n\nZhao et al.

Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 153(4), 1066–1075. https://doi.org/10.1037/xge0001547\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nA Large Language Model (LLM) is an artificial intelligence system trained on vast amounts of natural language data, enabling it to generate human-like responses to written or spoken language input. Generative Pre-Trained Transformer (GPT)-3.5 is an example of an LLM that supports a conversational agent called ChatGPT. In this work, we used a series of novel prompts to determine whether ChatGPT shows heuristics and other context-sensitive responses. We also tested the same prompts on human participants. Across four studies, we found that ChatGPT was influenced by random anchors in making estimates (anchoring, Study 1); it judged the likelihood of two events occurring together to be higher than the likelihood of either event occurring alone, and it was influenced by anecdotal information (representativeness and availability heuristic, Study 2); it found an item to be more efficacious when its features were presented positively rather than negatively—even though both presentations contained statistically equivalent information (framing effect, Study 3); and it valued an owned item more than a newly found item even though the two items were objectively identical (endowment effect, Study 4). In each study, human participants showed similar effects. Heuristics and context-sensitive responses in humans are thought to be driven by cognitive and affective processes such as loss aversion and effort reduction. The fact that an LLM—which lacks these processes—also shows such responses invites consideration of the possibility that language is sufficiently rich to carry these effects and may play a role in generating these effects in humans.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Suri et al.

Leveraging the extensive literature on intertemporal discounting for benchmarking, we examine responses from LLMs across various languages and compare them with human responses, exploring preferences between smaller, sooner and larger, later rewards. Our findings reveal that both generative pretrained transformer (GPT) models demonstrate less patience than humans, with GPT-3.5 exhibiting a lexicographic preference for earlier rewards unlike human decision makers. Although GPT-4 does not display lexicographic preferences, its measured discount rates are still considerably larger than those found in humans. Interestingly, GPT models show greater patience in languages with weak future tense references, such as German and Mandarin, aligning with the existing literature that suggests a correlation between language structure and intertemporal preferences. We demonstrate how prompting GPT to explain its decisions, a procedure we term “chain-of-thought conjoint,” can mitigate, but does not eliminate, discrepancies between LLM and human responses. Although directly eliciting preferences using LLMs may yield misleading results, combining chain-of-thought conjoint with topic modeling aids in hypothesis generation, enabling researchers to explore the underpinnings of preferences. Chain-of-thought conjoint provides a structured framework for marketers to use LLMs to identify potential attributes or factors that can explain preference heterogeneity across different customers and contexts.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Figures from Goli & Singh (2024)",

Large language models (LMs) achieve above-chance performance on abstract reasoning tasks but exhibit many imperfections. However, human abstract reasoning is also imperfect. Human reasoning is affected by our real-world knowledge and beliefs, and shows notable “content effects”; humans reason more reliably when the semantic content of a problem supports the correct logical inferences. These content-entangled reasoning patterns are central to debates about the fundamental nature of human intelligence. Here, we investigate whether language models—whose prior expectations capture some aspects of human knowledge—similarly mix content into their answers to logic problems. We explored this question across three logical reasoning tasks: natural language inference, judging the logical validity of syllogisms, and the Wason selection task. We evaluate state of the art LMs, as well as humans, and find that the LMs reflect many of the same qualitative human patterns on these tasks—like humans, models answer more accurately when the semantic content of a task supports the logical inferences. These parallels are reflected in accuracy patterns, and in some lower-level features like the relationship between LM confidence over possible answers and human response times. However, in some cases the humans and models behave differently—particularly on the Wason task, where humans perform much worse than large models, and exhibit a distinct error pattern. Our findings have implications for understanding possible contributors to these human cognitive effects, as well as the factors that influence language model performance.\n\n\nLampinen et al.

This paper examines the economic rationality of GPT by instructing it to make budgetary decisions in four domains: risk, time, social, and food preferences. We measure economic rationality by assessing the consistency of GPT’s decisions with utility maximization in classic revealed preference theory. We find that GPT’s decisions are largely rational in each domain and demonstrate higher rationality score than those of human subjects in a parallel experiment and in the literature. Moreover, the estimated preference parameters of GPT are slightly different from human subjects and exhibit a lower degree of heterogeneity. We also find that the rationality scores are robust to the degree of randomness and demographic settings such as age and gender but are sensitive to contexts based on the language frames of the choice situations. These results suggest the potential of LLMs to make good decisions and the need to further understand their capabilities, limitations, and underlying mechanisms.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Chen et al.

We demonstrate that the rapid advances in large language models (LLMs), like ChatGPT, could accelerate this influence by making personalized persuasion scalable. Across four studies (consisting of seven sub-studies; total N = 1788), we show that personalized messages crafted by ChatGPT exhibit significantly more influence than non-personalized messages. This was true across different domains of persuasion (e.g., marketing of consumer products, political appeals for climate action), psychological profiles (e.g., personality traits, political ideology, moral foundations), and when only providing the LLM with a single, short prompt naming or describing the targeted psychological dimension. Thus, our findings are among the first to demonstrate the potential for LLMs to automate, and thereby scale, the use of personalized persuasion in ways that enhance its effectiveness and efficiency.

We investigate the extent to which LLMs reflect human response biases, if at all. We look to survey design, where human response biases caused by changes in the wordings of “prompts” have been extensively explored in social psychology literature. Drawing from these works, we design a dataset and framework to evaluate whether LLMs exhibit human-like response biases in survey questionnaires. Our comprehensive evaluation of nine models shows that popular open and commercial LLMs generally fail to reflect human-like behavior, particularly in models that have undergone RLHF. Furthermore, even if a model shows a significant change in the same direction as humans, we find that they are sensitive to perturbations that do not elicit significant changes in humans. These results highlight the pitfalls of using LLMs as human proxies, and underscore the need for finer-grained characterizations of model behavior.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Tjuatja et al. (2024)",

Because Cognitive Architectures are famously developed for the purpose of modeling the internal mechanisms of human cognitive decision-making at a computational level, new investigations consider the goal of informing LLMs with the knowledge necessary for replicating such processes, e.g., guided perception, memory, goal-setting, and action. Previous approaches that use LLMs for grounded decision-making struggle with complex reasoning tasks that require slower, deliberate cognition over fast and intuitive inference—reporting issues related to the lack of sufficient grounding, as in hallucination. To resolve these challenges, we introduce LLM-ACTR, a novel neurosymbolic architecture that provides human-aligned and versatile decision-making by integrating the ACT-R Cognitive Architecture with LLMs. Our framework extracts and embeds knowledge of ACT-R’s internal decision-making process as latent neural representations, injects this information into trainable LLM adapter layers, and fine-tunes the LLMs for downstream prediction. Our experiments on novel Design for Manufacturing tasks show both improved task performance as well as improved grounded decision-making capability of our approach, compared to LLM-only baselines that leverage chain-of-thought reasoning strategies.",

Some researchers even propose using LLMs as participants in psychology experiments. It is therefore important to understand how well LLMs make moral decisions and how they compare to humans. We investigated this question in realistic moral dilemmas using prompts where GPT-4, Llama 3, and Claude 3 give advice and where they emulate a research participant. In Study 1, we compared responses from LLMs to a representative US sample (N = 285) for 22 dilemmas: social dilemmas that pitted self-interest against the greater good, and moral dilemmas that pitted utilitarian cost-benefit reasoning against deontological rules. In social dilemmas, LLMs were more altruistic than participants. In moral dilemmas, LLMs exhibited stronger omission bias than participants: they usually endorsed inaction over action. In Study 2 (N = 490, preregistered), we replicated this omission bias and document an additional bias: unlike humans, LLMs (except GPT-4o) tended to answer “no” in moral dilemmas, whereby the phrasing of the question influences the decision even when physical action remains the same. Our findings show that LLM moral decision-making amplifies human biases and introduces potentially problematic biases.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Cheung et al. (2024)",

Current literature focusses on how users interact with AI assistance when there is no time pressure, finding that different AI assistances have different benefits: some can reduce time taken while increasing overreliance on AI, while others do the opposite. The precise benefit can depend on both the user and task. In time-pressured scenarios, adapting when we show AI assistance is especially important: relying on the AI assistance can save time, and can therefore be beneficial when the AI is likely to be right. We would ideally adapt what AI assistance we show depending on various properties (of the task and of the user) in order to best trade off accuracy and time. We introduce a study where users have to answer a series of logic puzzles. We find that time pressure affects how users use different AI assistances, making some assistances more beneficial than others when compared to notime-pressure settings. We also find that a user’s overreliance rate is a key predictor of their behaviour: overreliers and not-overreliers use different AI assistance types differently. We find marginal correlations between a user’s overreliance rate (which is related to the user’s trust in AI recommendations) and their personality traits (Big Five Personality traits). Overall, our work suggests that AI assistances have different accuracy-time tradeoffs when people are under time pressure compared to no time pressure, and we explore how we might adapt AI assistances in this setting.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Swaroop et al.

To explore the MToM process, we conducted a mixed-design experiment using a large language model-driven AI agent with ToM and communication modules in a real-time shared-workspace task. We find that the agent’s ToM capability does not significantly impact team performance but enhances human understanding of the agent and the feeling of being understood. Most participants in our study believe verbal communication increases human burden, and the results show that bidirectional communication leads to lower HAT performance. We discuss the results’ implications for designing AI agents that collaborate with humans in real-time shared workspace tasks.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from S. Zhang et al. (2024)",

Frontiers in Psychology, 14. https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2023.1208019\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nIn this prospective observational study, we investigate the role of transactive memory and speaking up in human-AI teams comprising 180 intensive care (ICU) physicians and nurses working with AI in a simulated clinical environment. Our findings indicate that interactions with AI agents differ significantly from human interactions, as accessing information from AI agents is positively linked to a team’s ability to generate novel hypotheses and demonstrate speaking-up behavior, but only in higher-performing teams. Conversely, accessing information from human team members is negatively associated with these aspects, regardless of team performance. This study is a valuable contribution to the expanding field of research on human-AI teams and team science in general, as it emphasizes the necessity of incorporating AI agents as knowledge sources in a team’s transactive memory system, as well as highlighting their role as catalysts for speaking up. Practical implications include suggestions for the design of future AI systems and human-AI team training in healthcare and beyond.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nBienefeld et al. (2023)",

However, direct interpersonal communication is not necessary for TMS development or utilization. Nor do high-quality information-sharing processes always occur within developed TMS structures.

We describe an “alignment system” as a loosely interconnected set of cognitive processes that facilitate social interactions. As a dynamic, multi-component system, it is responsive to higher-level cognitive states such as shared beliefs and intentions (those involving collective intentionality) but can also give rise to such shared cognitive states via bottom-up processes. As an example of putative group cognition we turn to transactive memory and suggest how further research on alignment in these cases might reveal how such systems can be genuinely described as cognitive.

We envision machines that are not just tools for thought, but partners in thought: reasonable, insightful, knowledgeable, reliable, and trustworthy systems that think with us. Current artificial intelligence (AI) systems satisfy some of these criteria, some of the time. In this Perspective, we show how the science of collaborative cognition can be put to work to engineer systems that really can be called “thought partners,” systems built to meet our expectations and complement our limitations. We lay out several modes of collaborative thought in which humans and AI thought partners can engage and propose desiderata for human-compatible thought partnerships. Drawing on motifs from computational cognitive science, we motivate an alternative scaling path for the design of thought partners and ecosystems around their use through a Bayesian lens, whereby the partners we construct actively build and reason over models of the human and world.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Collins et al.

Task Allocation in Teams as a Multi-Armed Bandit. https://cocosci.princeton.edu/papers/marjieh2024task.pdf\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nHumans rely on efficient distribution of resources to transcend the abilities of individuals. Successful task allocation, whether in small teams or across large institutions, depends on individuals’ ability to discern their own and others’ strengths and weaknesses, and to optimally act on them. This dependence creates a tension between exploring the capabilities of others and exploiting the knowledge acquired so far, which can be challenging. How do people navigate this tension? To address this question, we propose a novel task allocation paradigm in which a human agent is asked to repeatedly allocate tasks in three distinct classes (categorizing a blurry image, detecting a noisy voice command, and solving an anagram) between themselves and two other (bot) team members to maximize team performance. We show that this problem can be recast as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit which allows us to compare people’s performance against two well-known strategies, Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). We find that humans are able to successfully integrate information about the capabilities of different team members to infer optimal allocations, and in some cases perform on par with these optimal strategies. Our approach opens up new avenues for studying the mechanisms underlying collective cooperation in teams.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Marjieh et al. (2024)",

Collective deliberation can be slow, difficult to scale, and unequally attentive to different voices. In this study, we trained an artificial intelligence (AI) to mediate human deliberation. Using participants’ personal opinions and critiques, the AI mediator iteratively generates and refines statements that express common ground among the group on social or political issues. Participants (N = 5734) preferred AI-generated statements to those written by human mediators, rating them as more informative, clear, and unbiased. Discussants often updated their views after the deliberation, converging on a shared perspective. Text embeddings revealed that successful group statements incorporated dissenting voices while respecting the majority position. These findings were replicated in a virtual citizens’ assembly involving a demographically representative sample of the UK population.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figures from Tessler et al.

Learning To Guide Human Decision Makers With Vision-Language Models (arXiv:2403.16501). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16501\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThere is increasing interest in developing AIs for assisting human decision-making in high-stakes tasks, such as medical diagnosis, for the purpose of improving decision quality and reducing cognitive strain. Mainstream approaches team up an expert with a machine learning model to which safer decisions are offloaded, thus letting the former focus on cases that demand their attention. his separation of responsibilities setup, however, is inadequate for high-stakes scenarios. On the one hand, the expert may end up over-relying on the machine’s decisions due to anchoring bias, thus losing the human oversight that is increasingly being required by regulatory agencies to ensure trustworthy AI. On the other hand, the expert is left entirely unassisted on the (typically hardest) decisions on which the model abstained. As a remedy, we introduce learning to guide (LTG), an alternative framework in which - rather than taking control from the human expert - the machine provides guidance useful for decision making, and the human is entirely responsible for coming up with a decision. In order to ensure guidance is interpretable} and task-specific, we develop SLOG, an approach for turning any vision-language model into a capable generator of textual guidance by leveraging a modicum of human feedback.

Using kidney allocation as a case study, we conducted a randomized human-subject experiment where workers were presented with ethical dilemmas in various conditions, including no AI recommendations, recommendations from a similar AI, and recommendations from a dissimilar AI. We found that recommendations provided by a dissimilar AI had a higher overall effect on human decisions than recommendations from a similar AI. However, when humans and AI disagreed, participants were more likely to change their decisions when provided with recommendations from a similar AI. The effect was not due to humans’ perceptions of the AI being similar, but rather due to the AI displaying similar ethical values through its recommendations. We also conduct a preliminary analysis on the relationship between value similarity and trust, and potential shifts in ethical preferences at the population-level.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from Narayanan et al.

However, users still face challenges initializing and refining prompts, and their cognitive barriers and biased perceptions further impede task completion. These issues reflect broader challenges identified within the fields of IS and interactive information retrieval (IIR). To address these, our approach integrates task context and user perceptions into human-ChatGPT interactions through prompt engineering. We developed a ChatGPT-like platform integrated with supportive functions, including perception articulation, prompt suggestion, and conversation explanation. Our findings of a user study demonstrate that the supportive functions help users manage expectations, reduce cognitive loads, better refine prompts, and increase user engagement. This research enhances our comprehension of designing proactive and user-centric systems with LLMs. It offers insights into evaluating human-LLM interactions and emphasizes potential challenges for under served users.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from",

Transitioning to Human-Centered AI: A Systematic Review of Theories, Scenarios, and Hypotheses in Human-AI Interactions. Proceedings of the Association for Information Science and Technology, 61(1), 673–678. https://doi.org/10.1002/pra2.1078\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nThis study conducted a systematic review of human-AI interaction (HAI)over the past decade for the implemented theories and scenarios, and the tested hypotheses to discover the changes in the current transition to human-centered AI (HCAI). Moving from acceptance theories, Computers are social actors (CASA), anthropomorphism, and the integrative trust model are the most frequent theories. Augmentation scenarios of decision-making, teamwork, and human-AI collaborations are common in the latest HAI studies. Users’ trust, acceptance, and intention to use an AI system are the main research targets in HAI studies. These trends show a clear transition toward HCAI. This paper also discusses opportunities tied to HAI studies based on the interconnections between the various theories, scenarios, and hypotheses.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 1: Figures from Wang et al.

Proceedings of the 2024 ACM SIGIR Conference on Human Information Interaction and Retrieval, 370–375. https://doi.org/10.1145/3627508.3638344\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nLarge language model (LLM) applications, such as ChatGPT, are a powerful tool for online information-seeking (IS) and problem-solving tasks. However, users still face challenges initializing and refining prompts, and their cognitive barriers and biased perceptions further impede task completion. These issues reflect broader challenges identified within the fields of IS and interactive information retrieval (IIR). To address these, our approach integrates task context and user perceptions into human-ChatGPT interactions through prompt engineering. We developed a ChatGPT-like platform integrated with supportive functions, including perception articulation, prompt suggestion, and conversation explanation. Our findings of a user study demonstrate that the supportive functions help users manage expectations, reduce cognitive loads, better refine prompts, and increase user engagement. This research enhances our comprehension of designing proactive and user-centric systems with LLMs. It offers insights into evaluating human-LLM interactions and emphasizes potential challenges for under served users.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure from",

Determinants of LLM-assisted Decision-Making (arXiv:2402.17385). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.17385\n\n\nAbstract\n\n\nDecision-making is a fundamental capability in everyday life. Large Language Models (LLMs) provide multifaceted support in enhancing human decision-making processes. However, understanding the influencing factors of LLM-assisted decision-making is crucial for enabling individuals to utilize LLM-provided advantages and minimize associated risks in order to make more informed and better decisions. This study presents the results of a comprehensive literature analysis, providing a structural overview and detailed analysis of determinants impacting decision-making with LLM support. In particular, we explore the effects of technological aspects of LLMs, including transparency and prompt engineering, psychological factors such as emotions and decision-making styles, as well as decisionspecific determinants such as task difficulty and accountability. In addition, the impact of the determinants on the decision-making process is illustrated via multiple application scenarios. Drawing from our analysis, we develop a dependency framework that systematizes possible interactions in terms of reciprocal interdependencies between these determinants. Our research reveals that, due to the multifaceted interactions with various determinants, factors such as trust in or reliance on LLMs, the user’s mental model, and the characteristics of information processing are identified as significant aspects influencing LLM-assisted decision-making processes. Our findings can be seen as crucial for improving decision quality in human-AI collaboration, empowering both users and organizations, and designing more effective LLM interfaces. Additionally, our work provides a foundation for future empirical investigations on the determinants of decision-making assisted by LLMs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Figures from Eigner & Händler (2024)",
