This study conducted a systematic review of human-AI interaction (HAI)over the past decade for the implemented theories and scenarios, and the tested hypotheses to discover the changes in the current transition to human-centered AI (HCAI). Moving from acceptance theories, Computers are social actors (CASA), anthropomorphism, and the integrative trust model are the most frequent theories. Augmentation scenarios of decision-making, teamwork, and human-AI collaborations are common in the latest HAI studies. Users' trust, acceptance, and intention to use an AI system are the main research targets in HAI studies. These trends show a clear transition toward HCAI. This paper also discusses opportunities tied to HAI studies based on the interconnections between the various theories, scenarios, and hypotheses.
