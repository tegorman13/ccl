There is a growing interest in using Large Language Models (LLMs) as agents to tackle real-world tasks that may require assessing complex situations. Yet, we have a limited understanding of LLMs’ reasoning and decision-making capabilities, partly stemming from a lack of dedicated evaluation benchmarks. As negotiating and compromising are key aspects of our everyday communication and collaboration, we propose using scorable negotiation games as a new evaluation framework for LLMs. We create a testbed of diverse text-based, multi-agent, multi-issue, semantically rich negotiation games, with easily tunable difficulty. To solve the challenge, agents need to have strong arithmetic, inference, exploration, and planning capabilities, while seamlessly integrating them. Via a systematic zero-shot Chain-of-Thought prompting (CoT), we show that agents can negotiate and consistently reach successful deals. We quantify the performance with multiple metrics and observe a large gap between GPT-4 and earlier models. Importantly, we test the generalization to new games and setups. Finally, we show that these games can help evaluate other critical aspects, such as the interaction dynamics between agents in the presence of greedy and adversarial players.

We propose a method for using a large language model, such as GPT-3, to simulate responses of different humans in a given context. We test our method by attempting to reproduce well-established economic, psycholinguistic, and social experiments. The method requires prompt templates for each experiment. Simulations are run by varying the (hypothetical) subject details, such as name, and analyzing the text generated by the language model. To validate our methodology, we use GPT-3 to simulate the Ultimatum Game, garden path sentences, risk aversion, and the Milgram Shock experiments. In order to address concerns of exposure to these studies in training data, we also evaluate simulations on novel variants of these studies. We show that it is possible to simulate responses of different people and that their responses are largely consistent with prior human studies from the literature. Using large language models as simulators offers advantages but also poses risks. Our use of a language model for simulation is contrasted with anthropomorphic views of a language model as having its own behavior.

In this prospective observational study, we investigate the role of transactive memory and speaking up in human-AI teams comprising 180 intensive care (ICU) physicians and nurses working with AI in a simulated clinical environment. Our findings indicate that interactions with AI agents differ significantly from human interactions, as accessing information from AI agents is positively linked to a team’s ability to generate novel hypotheses and demonstrate speaking-up behavior, but only in higher-performing teams. Conversely, accessing information from human team members is negatively associated with these aspects, regardless of team performance. This study is a valuable contribution to the expanding field of research on human-AI teams and team science in general, as it emphasizes the necessity of incorporating AI agents as knowledge sources in a team’s transactive memory system, as well as highlighting their role as catalysts for speaking up. Practical implications include suggestions for the design of future AI systems and human-AI team training in healthcare and beyond.</p>

Nature Human Behaviour, 1–13. https://doi.org/10.1038/s41562-024-01959-9 
Collective intelligence underpins the success of groups, organizations, markets and societies. Through distributed cognition and coordination, collectives can achieve outcomes that exceed the capabilities of individuals—even experts—resulting in improved accuracy and novel capabilities. Often, collective intelligence is supported by information technology, such as online prediction markets that elicit the ‘wisdom of crowds’, online forums that structure collective deliberation or digital platforms that crowdsource knowledge from the public. Large language models, however, are transforming how information is aggregated, accessed and transmitted online. Here we focus on the unique opportunities and challenges this transformation poses for collective intelligence. We bring together interdisciplinary perspectives from industry and academia to identify potential benefits, risks, policy-relevant considerations and open research questions, culminating in a call for a closer examination of how large language models affect humans’ ability to collectively tackle complex problems.

Group decision making plays a crucial role in our complex and interconnected world. The rise of AI technologies has the potential to provide data-driven insights to facilitate group decision making, although it is found that groups do not always utilize AI assistance appropriately. In this paper, we aim to examine whether and how the introduction of a devil’s advocate in the AI-assisted group deci- sion making processes could help groups better utilize AI assistance and change the perceptions of group processes during decision making. Inspired by the exceptional conversational capabilities ex- hibited by modern large language models (LLMs), we design four different styles of devil’s advocate powered by LLMs, varying their interactivity (i.e., interactive vs. non-interactive) and their target of objection (i.e., challenge the AI recommendation or the majority opinion within the group). Through a randomized human-subject experiment, we find evidence suggesting that LLM-powered devil’s advocates that argue against the AI model’s decision recommenda- tion have the potential to promote groups’ appropriate reliance on AI. Meanwhile, the introduction of LLM-powered devil’s advocate usually does not lead to substantial increases in people’s perceived workload for completing the group decision making tasks, while interactive LLM-powered devil’s advocates are perceived as more collaborating and of higher quality. We conclude by discussing the practical implications of our findings.

Human groups are able to converge to more accurate beliefs through deliberation, even in the presence of polarization and partisan bias — a phenomenon known as the “wisdom of partisan crowds.” Large Language Models (LLMs) are increasingly being used to simulate human collective behavior, yet few benchmarks exist for evaluating their dynamics against the behavior of human groups. In this paper, we examine the extent to which the wisdom of partisan crowds emerges in groups of LLM-based agents that are prompted to role-play as partisan personas (e.g., Democrat or Republican). We find that they not only display human-like partisan biases, but also converge to more accurate beliefs through deliberation, as humans do. We then identify several factors that interfere with convergence, including the use of chain-of-thought prompting and lack of details in personas. Conversely, fine-tuning on human data appears to enhance convergence. These findings show the potential and limitations of LLM-based agents as a model of human collective intelligence.

This study investigates the potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate human group dynamics, particularly within politically charged contexts. We replicate the Wisdom of Partisan Crowds phenomenon using LLMs to role-play as Democrat and Republican personas, engaging in a structured interaction akin to human group study. Our approach evaluates how agents’ responses evolve through social influence. Our key findings indicate that LLM agents role-playing detailed personas and without Chain-of-Thought (CoT) reasoning closely align with human behaviors, while having CoT reasoning hurts the alignment. However, incorporating explicit biases into agent prompts does not necessarily enhance the wisdom of partisan crowds. Moreover, fine-tuning LLMs with human data shows promise in achieving human-like behavior but poses a risk of overfitting certain behaviors. These findings show the potential and limitations of using LLM agents in modeling human group phenomena.
 
Cisneros-Velarde, P. (2024). On the Principles behind Opinion Dynamics in Multi-Agent Systems of Large Language Models. 
We study the evolution of opinions inside a population of interacting large language models (LLMs). Every LLM needs to decide how much funding to allocate to an item with three initial possibilities: full, partial, or no funding. We identify biases that drive the exchange of opinions based on the LLM’s tendency to (i) find consensus with the other LLM’s opinion, (ii) display caution when specifying funding, and (iii) consider ethical concerns in its opinion. We find these biases are affected by the perceived absence of compelling reasons for opinion change, the perceived willingness to engage in discussion, and the distribution of allocation values. Moreover, tensions among biases can lead to the survival of funding for items with negative connotations. We also find that the final distribution of full, partial, and no funding opinions is more diverse when an LLM freely forms its opinion after an interaction than when its opinion is a multiple-choice selection among the three allocation options. In the latter case, consensus or polarization is generally attained. When agents are aware of past opinions, they seek to maintain consistency with them, and more diverse updating rules emerge. Our study is performed using a Llama 3 LLM.

What do we want from machine intelligence? We envision machines that are not just tools for thought, but partners in thought: reasonable, insightful, knowledgeable, reliable, and trustworthy systems that think with us. Current artificial intelligence (AI) systems satisfy some of these criteria, some of the time. In this Perspective, we show how the science of collaborative cognition can be put to work to engineer systems that really can be called “thought partners,” systems built to meet our expectations and complement our limitations. We lay out several modes of collaborative thought in which humans and AI thought partners can engage and propose desiderata for human-compatible thought partnerships. Drawing on motifs from computational cognitive science, we motivate an alternative scaling path for the design of thought partners and ecosystems around their use through a Bayesian lens, whereby the partners we construct actively build and reason over models of the human and world.

The current societal challenges exceed the capacity of human individual or collective effort alone. As AI evolves, its role within human collectives is poised to vary from an assistive tool to a participatory member. Humans and AI possess complementary capabilities that, when synergized, can achieve a level of collective intelligence that surpasses the collective capabilities of either humans or AI in isolation. However, the interactions in human-AI systems are inherently complex, involving intricate processes and interdependencies. This review incorporates perspectives from network science to conceptualize a multilayer representation of human-AI collective intelligence, comprising a cognition layer, a physical layer, and an information layer. Within this multilayer network, humans and AI agents exhibit varying characteristics; humans differ in diversity from surface-level to deep-level attributes, while AI agents range in degrees of functionality and anthropomorphism. The interplay among these agents shapes the overall structure and dynamics of the system. We explore how agents’ diversity and interactions influence the system’s collective intelligence. Furthermore, we present an analysis of real-world instances of AI-enhanced collective intelligence. We conclude by addressing the potential challenges in AI-enhanced collective intelligence and offer perspectives on future developments in this field.
 
Du, Y., Rajivan, P., & Gonzalez, C. C. (2024). Large Language Models for Collective Problem-Solving: Insights into Group Consensus Decision-Making. https://escholarship.org/uc/item/6s060914 
Large Language models (LLM) exhibit human-like proficiency in various tasks such as translation, question answering, essay writing, and programming. Emerging research explores the use of LLMs in collective problem-solving endeavors, such as tasks where groups try to uncover clues through discussions. Although prior work has investigated individual problem-solving tasks, leveraging LLM-powered agents for group consensus and decision-making remains largely unexplored. This research addresses this gap by (1) proposing an algorithm to enable free-form conversation in groups of LLM agents, (2) creating metrics to evaluate the human-likeness of the generated dialogue and problem-solving performance, and (3) evaluating LLM agent groups against human groups using an open source dataset. Our results reveal that LLM groups outperform human groups in problem-solving tasks. LLM groups also show a greater improvement in scores after participating in free discussions. In particular, analyses indicate that LLM agent groups exhibit more disagreements, complex statements, and a propensity for positive statements compared to human groups. The results shed light on the potential of LLMs to facilitate collective reasoning and provide insight into the dynamics of group interactions involving synthetic LLM agents.

Game theory, as an analytical tool, is frequently utilized to analyze human behavior in social science research. With the high alignment between the behavior of Large Language Models (LLMs) and humans, a promising research direction is to employ LLMs as substitutes for humans in game experiments, enabling social science research. However, despite numerous empirical researches on the combination of LLMs and game theory, the capability boundaries of LLMs in game theory remain unclear. In this research, we endeavor to systematically analyze LLMs in the context of game theory. Specifically, rationality, as the fundamental principle of game theory, serves as the metric for evaluating players’ behavior — building a clear desire, refining belief about uncertainty, and taking optimal actions. Accordingly, we select three classical games (dictator game, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and ringnetwork game) to analyze to what extent LLMs can achieve rationality in these three aspects. The experimental results indicate that even the current state-of-the-art LLM (GPT-4) exhibits substantial disparities compared to humans in game theory. For instance, LLMs struggle to build desires based on uncommon preferences, fail to refine belief from many simple patterns, and may overlook or modify refined belief when taking actions. Therefore, we consider that introducing LLMs into game experiments in the field of social science should be approached with greater caution.

Machine learning augmentation reduces prediction error in collective forecasting: Development and validation across prediction markets (p. 2023.01.19.23284578). medRxiv. https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.01.19.23284578 
The recent COVID-19 crisis highlighted the inadequacy of human forecasting. We aim to leverage human prediction markets with real-time machine weighting of likely higher accuracy trades to improve performance. The crowd sourced Almanis prediction market longitudinal platform (n=1822) and Next Generation Social Science (NGS2) platform (n=103) were utilised. A 43-feature model predicted top quintile relative Brier accuracy scores in two out-of-sample datasets (pboth<1×10−9). Trades graded as high machine accuracy quality vs. other trades had a greater AUC temporal gain from before to after trade. Hybrid human-machine forecasts had higher accuracy than human forecasts alone, particularly when the two systems disagreed by 5% or more for binary event prediction: the hybrid system demonstrating substantial AUC gains of 13.2%, p=1.35×10−14 and 13.8%, p=0.003 in the out-of-sample Almanis B and NGS2 datasets respectively. When discordant, the hybrid model was correct for COVID-19 event occurrence 72.7% of the time vs 27.3% for human-only models, p=0.007. This net classification benefit was replicated in the separate Almanis B dataset, p=2.4×10−7. Real-time machine classification followed by weighting human trades according to likely accuracy improves collective forecasting performance. Implementation may allow improved anticipation of and response to emerging risks and improved human collective efforts generally. Significance Statement Human-machine hybrid approaches have been identified as a new frontier for event prediction and decision making in the artificial intelligence and collective human intelligence fields. For the first time, we present the successful development and validation of a human-machine hybrid prediction market approach and demonstrate its superior accuracy when compared to prediction markets based on human forecasting alone. The advantages of this new hybrid system are demonstrated in the context of COVID-19-related event prediction.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have emerged as integral tools for reasoning, planning, and decision-making, drawing upon their extensive world knowledge and proficiency in language-related tasks. LLMs thus hold tremendous potential for natural language interaction within multi-agent systems to foster cooperation. However, LLM agents tend to over-report and comply with any instruction, which may result in information redundancy and confusion in multi-agent cooperation. Inspired by human organizations, this paper introduces a framework that imposes prompt-based organization structures on LLM agents to mitigate these problems. Through a series of experiments with embodied LLM agents and human-agent collaboration, our results highlight the impact of designated leadership on team efficiency, shedding light on the leadership qualities displayed by LLM agents and their spontaneous cooperative behaviors. Further, we harness the potential of LLMs to propose enhanced organizational prompts, via a Criticize-Reflect process, resulting in novel organization structures that reduce communication costs and enhance team efficiency1.

Decision-making, a complicated task requiring various types of abilities, presents an excellent framework for assessing Large Language Models (LLMs). Our research investigates decision-making capabilities of LLMs through the lens of Game Theory. We focus specifically on games that support the simultaneous participation of more than two agents. We introduce GAMA(γ)-Bench, which evaluates LLMs’ Gaming Ability in Multi-Agent environments. γ-Bench includes eight classical multi-agent games and a scoring scheme specially designed to quantitatively assess LLMs’ performance. Leveraging γ-Bench, we investigate LLMs’ robustness, generalizability, and strategies for enhancement. Results reveal that while GPT-3.5 shows satisfying robustness, its generalizability is relatively limited. However, its performance can be improved through approaches such as Chain-of-Thought. Additionally, we evaluate twelve versions from six models, including GPT-3.5, GPT-4, Gemini, LLaMA-3.1, Mixtral, and Qwen-2. We find that Gemini-1.5-Pro outperforms other models with a score of 63.8 out of 100, followed by LLaMA-3.1-70B and GPT-4 with scores of 60.9 and 60.5, respectively.

In this study, we introduce “CosmoAgent,” an innovative artificial intelligence framework utilizing Large Language Models (LLMs) to simulate complex interactions between human and extraterrestrial civilizations, with a special emphasis on Stephen Hawking’s cautionary advice about not sending radio signals haphazardly into the universe. The goal is to assess the feasibility of peaceful coexistence while considering potential risks that could threaten well-intentioned civilizations. Employing mathematical models and state transition matrices, our approach quantitatively evaluates the development trajectories of civilizations, offering insights into future decision-making at critical points of growth and saturation. Furthermore, the paper acknowledges the vast diversity in potential living conditions across the universe, which could foster unique cosmologies, ethical codes, and worldviews among various civilizations. Recognizing the Earth-centric bias inherent in current LLM designs, we propose the novel concept of using LLMs with diverse ethical paradigms and simulating interactions between entities with distinct moral principles. This innovative research provides a new way to understand complex inter-civilizational dynamics, expanding our perspective while pioneering novel strategies for conflict resolution, crucial for preventing interstellar conflicts. We have also released the code and datasets to enable further academic investigation into this interesting area of research. The code is available at https://github.com/agiresearch/AlienAgent.

Foundation models have become invaluable in advancing the medical field. Despite their promise, the strategic deployment of LLMs for effective utility in complex medical tasks remains an open question. Our novel framework, Medical Decision-making Agents (MDAgents) aims to address this gap by automatically assigning the effective collaboration structure for LLMs. Assigned solo or group collaboration structure is tailored to the complexity of the medical task at hand, emulating real-world medical decision making processes. We evaluate our framework and baseline methods with state-of-the-art LLMs across a suite of challenging medical benchmarks: MedQA, MedMCQA, PubMedQA, DDXPlus, PMC-VQA, Path-VQA, and MedVidQA, achieving the best performance in 5 out of 7 benchmarks that require an understanding of multi-modal medical reasoning. Ablation studies reveal that MDAgents excels in adapting the number of collaborating agents to optimize efficiency and accuracy, showcasing its robustness in diverse scenarios. We also explore the dynamics of group consensus, offering insights into how collaborative agents could behave in complex clinical team dynamics. Our code can be found at https://github.com/mitmedialab/MDAgents.

Qualitative self-report methods such as think-aloud procedures and open-ended response questions can provide valuable data to human factors research. These measures come with analytic weaknesses, such as researcher bias, intra- and inter-rater reliability concerns, and time-consuming coding protocols. A possible solution exists in the latent semantic patterns that exist in machine learning large language models. These semantic patterns could be used to analyze qualitative responses. This exploratory research compared the statistical quality of automated sentence coding using large language models to the benchmarks of self-report and behavioral measures within the context of trust in automation research. The results indicated that three large language models show promise as tools for analyzing qualitative responses. The study also provides insight on minimum sample sizes for model creation and offers recommendations for further validating the robustness of large language models as research tools.
 
Leng, Y., & Yuan, Y. (2024). Do LLM Agents Exhibit Social Behavior? (arXiv:2312.15198). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2312.15198 
The advances of Large Language Models (LLMs) are expanding their utility in both academic research and practical applications. Recent social science research has explored the use of these ``black-box’’ LLM agents for simulating complex social systems and potentially substituting human subjects in experiments. Our study delves into this emerging domain, investigating the extent to which LLMs exhibit key social interaction principles, such as social learning, social preference, and cooperative behavior (indirect reciprocity), in their interactions with humans and other agents. We develop a framework for our study, wherein classical laboratory experiments involving human subjects are adapted to use LLM agents. This approach involves step-by-step reasoning that mirrors human cognitive processes and zero-shot learning to assess the innate preferences of LLMs. Our analysis of LLM agents’ behavior includes both the primary effects and an in-depth examination of the underlying mechanisms. Focusing on GPT-4, our analyses suggest that LLM agents appear to exhibit a range of human-like social behaviors such as distributional and reciprocity preferences, responsiveness to group identity cues, engagement in indirect reciprocity, and social learning capabilities. However, our analysis also reveals notable differences: LLMs demonstrate a pronounced fairness preference, weaker positive reciprocity, and a more calculating approach in social learning compared to humans. These insights indicate that while LLMs hold great promise for applications in social science research, such as in laboratory experiments and agent-based modeling, the subtle behavioral differences between LLM agents and humans warrant further investigation. Careful examination and development of protocols in evaluating the social behaviors of LLMs are necessary before directly applying these models to emulate human behavior.
 
Marjieh, R., Gokhale, A., Bullo, F., & Griffiths, T. L. (2024). Task Allocation in Teams as a Multi-Armed Bandit. https://cocosci.princeton.edu/papers/marjieh2024task.pdf 
Humans rely on efficient distribution of resources to transcend the abilities of individuals. Successful task allocation, whether in small teams or across large institutions, depends on individuals’ ability to discern their own and others’ strengths and weaknesses, and to optimally act on them. This dependence creates a tension between exploring the capabilities of others and exploiting the knowledge acquired so far, which can be challenging. How do people navigate this tension? To address this question, we propose a novel task allocation paradigm in which a human agent is asked to repeatedly allocate tasks in three distinct classes (categorizing a blurry image, detecting a noisy voice command, and solving an anagram) between themselves and two other (bot) team members to maximize team performance. We show that this problem can be recast as a combinatorial multi-armed bandit which allows us to compare people’s performance against two well-known strategies, Thompson Sampling and Upper Confidence Bound (UCB). We find that humans are able to successfully integrate information about the capabilities of different team members to infer optimal allocations, and in some cases perform on par with these optimal strategies. Our approach opens up new avenues for studying the mechanisms underlying collective cooperation in teams.

Large Language Models (LLMs) have taken the field of AI by storm, but their adoption in the field of Artificial Life (ALife) has been, so far, relatively reserved. In this work we investigate the potential synergies betweens LLMs and ALife, drawing on a large body of research in the two fields. We explore the potential of LLMs as tools for ALife research, for example, as operators for evolutionary computation or the generation of open-ended environments. Reciprocally, principles of ALife, such as self-organization, collective intelligence and evolvability can provide an opportunity for shaping the development and functionalities of LLMs, leading to more adaptive and responsive models. By investigating this dynamic interplay, the paper aims to inspire innovative crossover approaches for both ALife and LLM research. Along the way, we examine the extent to which LLMs appear to increasingly exhibit properties such as emergence or collective intelligence, expanding beyond their original goal of generating text, and potentially redefining our perception of lifelike intelligence in artificial systems.

Human culture relies on collective innovation: our ability to continuously explore how existing elements in our environment can be combined to create new ones. Language is hypothesized to play a key role in human culture, driving individual cognitive capacities and shaping communication. Yet the majority of models of collective innovation assign no cognitive capacities or language abilities to agents. Here, we contribute a computational study of collective innovation where agents are Large Language Models (LLMs) that play Little Alchemy 2, a creative video game originally developed for humans that, as we argue, captures useful aspects of innovation landscapes not present in previous test-beds. We, first, study an LLM in isolation and discover that it exhibits both useful skills and crucial limitations. We, then, study groups of LLMs that share information related to their behaviour and focus on the effect of social connectivity on collective performance. In agreement with previous human and computational studies, we observe that groups with dynamic connectivity out-compete fully-connected groups. Our work reveals opportunities and challenges for future studies of collective innovation that are becoming increasingly relevant as Generative Artificial Intelligence algorithms and humans innovate alongside each other.
 
Papachristou, M., & Yuan, Y. (2024). Network Formation and Dynamics Among Multi-LLMs (arXiv:2402.10659). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.10659 
Social networks shape opinions, behaviors, and information dissemination in human societies. As large language models (LLMs) increasingly integrate into social and professional environments, understanding their behavior within the context of social interactions and networks becomes essential. Our study analyzes LLMs’ network formation behavior to examine whether the dynamics of multiple LLMs are similar to or different from human social dynamics. We observe that LLMs exhibit key social network principles, including preferential attachment, triadic closure, homophily, community structure, and the small-world phenomenon, when asked about their preferences in network formation. We also investigate LLMs’ decision-making based on real-world networks, revealing that triadic closure and homophily have a stronger influence than preferential attachment and that LLMs perform well in network formation predictions. Overall, our study opens up new possibilities for using LLMs in network science research and helps develop socially aware LLMs by shedding light on their social interaction behaviors and exploring their impacts on social dynamics.

As AI systems pervade human life, ensuring that large language models (LLMs) make safe decisions remains a significant challenge. We introduce the Governance of the Commons Simulation (GovSim), a generative simulation platform designed to study strategic interactions and cooperative decision-making in LLMs. In GovSim, a society of AI agents must collectively balance exploiting a common resource with sustaining it for future use. This environment enables the study of how ethical considerations, strategic planning, and negotiation skills impact cooperative outcomes. We develop an LLM-based agent architecture and test it with the leading open and closed LLMs. We find that all but the most powerful LLM agents fail to achieve a sustainable equilibrium in GovSim, with the highest survival rate below 54%. Ablations reveal that successful multi-agent communication between agents is critical for achieving cooperation in these cases. Furthermore, our analyses show that the failure to achieve sustainable cooperation in most LLMs stems from their inability to formulate and analyze hypotheses about the long-term effects of their actions on the equilibrium of the group. Finally, we show that agents that leverage “Universalization”-based reasoning, a theory of moral thinking, are able to achieve significantly better sustainability. Taken together, GovSim enables us to study the mechanisms that underlie sustainable self-government with specificity and scale. We open source the full suite of our research results, including the simulation environment, agent prompts, and a comprehensive web interface.

Large language models exhibit societal biases associated with demographic information, including race, gender, and others. Endowing such language models with personalities based on demographic data can enable generating opinions that align with those of humans. Building on this idea, we propose “random silicon sampling,” a method to emulate the opinions of the human population subgroup. Our study analyzed 1) a language model that generates the survey responses that correspond with a human group based solely on its demographic distribution and 2) the applicability of our methodology across various demographic subgroups and thematic questions. Through random silicon sampling and using only group-level demographic information, we discovered that language models can generate response distributions that are remarkably similar to the actual U.S. public opinion polls. Moreover, we found that the replicability of language models varies depending on the demographic group and topic of the question, and this can be attributed to inherent societal biases in the models. Our findings demonstrate the feasibility of mirroring a group’s opinion using only demographic distribution and elucidate the effect of social biases in language models on such simulations.

In the rapidly evolving landscape of artificial intelligence (AI), the collaboration between human intelligence and AI systems, known as Human-AI (HAI) Teaming, has emerged as a cornerstone for advancing problem-solving and decision-making processes. The advent of Large Pre-trained Models (LPtM) has significantly transformed this landscape, offering unprecedented capabilities by leveraging vast amounts of data to understand and predict complex patterns. This paper surveys the pivotal integration of LPtMs with HAI, emphasizing how these models enhance collaborative intelligence beyond traditional approaches. It examines the potential of LPtMs in augmenting human capabilities, discussing this collaboration for AI model improvements, effective teaming, ethical considerations, and their broad applied implications in various sectors. Through this exploration, the study sheds light on the transformative impact of LPtM-enhanced HAI Teaming, providing insights for future research, policy development, and strategic implementations aimed at harnessing the full potential of this collaboration for research and societal benefit.
 
Wang, A., Morgenstern, J., & Dickerson, J. P. (2024). Large language models cannot replace human participants because they cannot portray identity groups (arXiv:2402.01908). arXiv. http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.01908 
Large language models (LLMs) are increasing in capability and popularity, propelling their application in new domains -- including as replacements for human participants in computational social science, user testing, annotation tasks, and more. Traditionally, in all of these settings survey distributors are careful to find representative samples of the human population to ensure the validity of their results and understand potential demographic differences. This means in order to be a suitable replacement, LLMs will need to be able to capture the influence of positionality (i.e., relevance of social identities like gender and race). However, we show that there are two inherent limitations in the way current LLMs are trained that prevent this. We argue analytically for why LLMs are doomed to both misportray and flatten the representations of demographic groups, then empirically show this to be true on 4 LLMs through a series of human studies with 3200 participants across 16 demographic identities. We also discuss a third consideration about how identity prompts can essentialize identities. Throughout, we connect each of these limitations to a pernicious history that shows why each is harmful for marginalized demographic groups. Overall, we urge caution in use cases where LLMs are intended to replace human participants whose identities are relevant to the task at hand. At the same time, in cases where the goal is to supplement rather than replace (e.g., pilot studies), we provide empirically-better inference-time techniques to reduce, but not remove, these harms.

Large language models (LLMs) have shown remarkable perfor- mance across various natural language processing (NLP) tasks, indicating their significant potential as data annotators. Although LLM-generated annotations are more cost-effective and efficient to obtain, they are often erroneous for complex or domain-specific tasks and may introduce bias when compared to human annota- tions. Therefore, instead of completely replacing human annotators with LLMs, we need to leverage the strengths of both LLMs and humans to ensure the accuracy and reliability of annotations. This paper presents a multi-step human-LLM collaborative approach where (1) LLMs generate labels and provide explanations, (2) a ver- ifier assesses the quality of LLM-generated labels, and (3) human annotators re-annotate a subset of labels with lower verification scores. To facilitate human-LLM collaboration, we make use of LLM’s ability to rationalize its decisions. LLM-generated explana- tions can provide additional information to the verifier model as well as help humans better understand LLM labels. We demonstrate that our verifier is able to identify potentially incorrect LLM labels for human re-annotation. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of presenting LLM labels and explanations on human re-annotation through crowdsourced studies.

This paper investigates the voting behaviors of Large Language Models (LLMs), specifically GPT-4 and LLaMA-2, their biases, and how they align with human voting patterns. Our methodology involved using a dataset from a human voting experiment to establish a baseline for human preferences and conducting a corresponding experiment with LLM agents. We observed that the choice of voting methods and the presentation order influenced LLM voting outcomes. We found that varying the persona can reduce some of these biases and enhance alignment with human choices. While the Chain-of-Thought approach did not improve prediction accuracy, it has potential for AI explainability in the voting process. We also identified a trade-off between preference diversity and alignment accuracy in LLMs, influenced by different temperature settings. Our findings indicate that LLMs may lead to less diverse collective outcomes and biased assumptions when used in voting scenarios, emphasizing the need for cautious integration of LLMs into democratic processes.

As Natural Language Processing (NLP) systems are increasingly employed in intricate social environments, a pressing query emerges: Can these NLP systems mirror human-esque collaborative intelligence, in a multi-agent society consisting of multiple large language models (LLMs)? This paper probes the collaboration mechanisms among contemporary NLP systems by melding practical experiments with theoretical insights. We fabricate four unique ‘societies’ comprised of LLM agents, where each agent is characterized by a specific ‘trait’ (easy-going or overconfident) and engages in collaboration with a distinct ‘thinking pattern’ (debate or reflection). Through evaluating these multi-agent societies on three benchmark datasets, we discern that certain collaborative strategies not only outshine previous top-tier approaches but also optimize efficiency (using fewer API tokens). Moreover, our results further illustrate that LLM agents manifest humanlike social behaviors, such as conformity and consensus reaching, mirroring foundational social psychology theories. In conclusion, we integrate insights from social psychology to contextualize the collaboration of LLM agents, inspiring further investigations into the collaboration mechanism for LLMs. We have shared our code and datasets1, hoping to catalyze further research in this promising avenue.

Large language models (LLMs) have been employed in various intelligent educational tasks to assist teaching. While preliminary explorations have focused on independent LLMempowered agents for specific educational tasks, the potential for LLMs within a multiagent collaborative framework to simulate a classroom with real user participation remains unexplored. In this work, we propose SimClass, a multi-agent classroom simulation framework involving user participation. We recognize representative class roles and introduce a novel class control mechanism for automatic classroom teaching, and conduct user experiments in two real-world courses. Utilizing the Flanders Interactive Analysis System and Community of Inquiry theoretical frame works from educational analysis, we demonstrate that LLMs can simulate traditional classroom interaction patterns effectively while enhancing user’s experience. We also observe emergent group behaviors among agents in SimClass, where agents collaborate to create enlivening interactions in classrooms to improve user learning process. We hope this work pioneers the application of LLM-empowered multi-agent systems in virtual classroom teaching.
