### Structuring Knowledge with Cognitive Maps and Cognitive Graphs. 

Peer, M., Brunec, I. K., Newcombe, N. S., & Epstein, R. A. (2021). **Structuring Knowledge with Cognitive Maps and Cognitive Graphs.** Trends in Cognitive Sciences, 25(1), 37–54. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.tics.2020.10.004

<div>
Humans and animals use mental representations of the spatial structure of the
world to navigate. The classical view is that these representations take the
form of Euclidean cognitive maps, but alternative theories suggest that they
are cognitive graphs consisting of locations connected by paths. We review
evidence suggesting that both map-like and graph-like representations exist in
the mind/brain that rely on partially overlapping neural systems. Maps and
graphs can operate simultaneously or separately, and they may be applied to
both spatial and nonspatial knowledge. By providing structural frameworks for
complex information, cognitive maps and cognitive graphs may provide fundamental organizing schemata that allow us to navigate in physical, social, and
conceptual spaces.

### Wormholes in virtual space: From cognitive maps to cognitive graphs

Warren, W. H., Rothman, D. B., Schnapp, B. H., & Ericson, J. D. (2017). **Wormholes in virtual space: From cognitive maps to cognitive graphs.** Cognition, 166, 152–163. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.cognition.2017.05.020

<details open class="relevant-callout">
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div>
Humans and other animals build up spatial knowledge of the environment on the basis of visual information and path integration. We compare three hypotheses about the geometry of this knowledge of navigation space: (a) ‘cognitive map’ with metric Euclidean structure and a consistent coordinate system, (b) ‘topological graph’ or network of paths between places, and (c) ‘labelled graph’ incorporating local metric information about path lengths and junction angles. In two experiments, participants walked in a non-Euclidean environment, a virtual hedge maze containing two ‘wormholes’ that visually rotated and teleported them between locations. During training, they learned the metric locations of eight target objects from a ‘home’ location, which were visible individually. During testing, shorter wormhole routes to a target were preferred, and novel shortcuts were directional, contrary to the topological hypothesis. Shortcuts were strongly biased by the wormholes, with mean constant errors of 37° and 41° (45° expected), revealing violations of the metric postulates in spatial knowledge. In addition, shortcuts to targets near wormholes shifted relative to flanking targets, revealing ‘rips’ (86% of cases), 'folds' (91%), and ordinal reversals (66%) in spatial knowledge. Moreover, participants were completely unaware of these geometric inconsistencies, reflecting a surprising insensitivity to Euclidean structure. The probability of the shortcut data under the Euclidean map model and labelled graph model indicated decisive support for the latter (BFGM>100). We conclude that knowledge of navigation space is best characterized by a labelled graph, in which local metric information is approximate, geometrically inconsistent, and not embedded in a common coordinate system. This class of ‘cognitive graph’ models supports route finding, novel detours, and rough shortcuts, and has the potential to unify a range of data on spatial navigation.

### Route effects in city-based survey knowledge estimates

Krukar, J., Navas Medrano, S., & Schwering, A. (2023). **Route effects in city-based survey knowledge estimates.** Cognitive Processing, 24(2), 213–231. https://doi.org/10.1007/s10339-022-01122-0

<details open class="relevant-callout">
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div>
When studying wayfinding in urban environments, researchers are often interested in obtaining measures of participants’ survey knowledge, i.e., their estimate of distant locations relative to other places. Previous work showed that distance estimations are consistently biased when no direct route is available to the queried target or when participants follow a detour. Here we investigated whether a corresponding bias is manifested in two other popular measures of survey knowledge: a pointing task and a sketchmapping task. The aim of this study was to investigate whether there is a systematic bias in pointing/sketchmapping performance associated with the preferred route choice in an applied urban setting. The results were mixed. We found moderate evidence for the presence of a systematic bias, but only for a subset of urban locations. When two plausible routes to the target were available, survey knowledge estimates were significantly biased in the direction of the route chosen by the participant. When only one plausible route was available, we did not find a statistically significant pattern. The results may have methodological implications for spatial cognition studies in applied urban settings that might be obtaining systematically biased survey knowledge estimates at some urban locations. Researchers should be aware that the choice of urban locations from which pointing and sketchmapping are performed might systematically distort the results, in particular when two plausible but diverging routes to the target are visible from the location.

### Spatial decision dynamics during wayfinding: Intersections prompt the decision-making process.

Brunyé, T. T., Gardony, A. L., Holmes, A., & Taylor, H. A. (2018). **Spatial decision dynamics during wayfinding: Intersections prompt the decision-making process.** Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications, 3(1), 13. https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-018-0098-3

<details open class="relevant-callout">
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div>
Intersections are critical decision points for wayfinders, but it is unknown how decision dynamics unfold during pedestrian wayfinding. Some research implies that pedestrians leverage available visual cues to actively compare options while in an intersection, whereas other research suggests that people strive to make decisions long before overt responses are required. Two experiments examined these possibilities while participants navigated virtual desktop environments, assessing information-seeking behavior (Experiment 1) and movement dynamics (Experiment 2) while approaching intersections. In Experiment 1, we found that participants requested navigation guidance while in path segments approaching an intersection and the guidance facilitated choice behavior. In Experiment 2, we found that participants tended to orient themselves toward an upcoming turn direction before entering an intersection, particularly as they became more familiar with the environment. Some of these patterns were modulated by individual differences in spatial ability, sense of direction, spatial strategies, and gender. Together, we provide novel evidence that deciding whether to continue straight or turn involves a dynamic, distributed decision-making process that is prompted by upcoming intersections and modulated by individual differences and environmental experience. We discuss implications of these results for spatial decision-making theory and the development of innovative adaptive, beacon-based navigation guidance systems.

<details open class="relevant-callout">

<div>
We tested four hypotheses about the structure of spatial knowledge used for navigation: (1) the Euclidean hypothesis, a geometrically consistent map; (2) the Neighborhood hypothesis, adjacency relations between spatial regions, based on visible boundaries; (3) the Cognitive Graph hypothesis, a network of paths between places, labeled with approximate local distances and angles; and (4) the Constancy hypothesis, whatever geometric properties are invariant during learning. In two experiments, different groups of participants learned three virtual hedge mazes, which varied specific geometric properties (Euclidean Control Maze, Elastic Maze with stretching paths, Swap Maze with alternating paths to the same place). Spatial knowledge was then tested using three navigation tasks (metric shortcuts on empty ground plane, neighborhood shortcuts with visible boundaries, route task in corridors). They yielded the following results: (a) Metric shortcuts were insensitive to detectable shifts in target location, inconsistent with the Euclidean hypothesis. (b) Neighborhood shortcuts were constrained by visible boundaries in the Elastic Maze, but not in the Swap Maze, contrary to the Neighborhood and Constancy hypotheses. (c) The route task indicated that a graph of the maze was acquired in all environments, including knowledge of local path lengths. We conclude that primary spatial knowledge is consistent with the Cognitive Graph hypothesis. Neighborhoods are derived from the graph, and local distance and angle information is not embedded in a geometrically consistent map.

<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div>
We present Scalable Insets, a technique for interactively exploring and navigating large numbers of annotated patterns in multiscale visualizations such as gigapixel images, matrices, or maps. Exploration of many but sparsely-distributed patterns in multiscale visualizations is challenging as visual representations change across zoom levels, context and navigational cues get lost upon zooming, and navigation is time consuming. Our technique visualizes annotated patterns too small to be identifiable at certain zoom levels using insets, i.e., magnified thumbnail views of the annotated patterns. Insets support users in searching, comparing, and contextualizing patterns while reducing the amount of navigation needed. They are dynamically placed either within the viewport or along the boundary of the viewport to offer a compromise between locality and context preservation. Annotated patterns are interactively clustered by location and type. They are visually represented as an aggregated inset to provide scalable exploration within a single viewport. In a controlled user study with 18 participants, we found that Scalable Insets can speed up visual search and improve the accuracy of pattern comparison at the cost of slower frequency estimation compared to a baseline technique. A second study with 6 experts in the field of genomics showed that Scalable Insets is easy to learn and provides first insights into how Scalable Insets can be applied in an open-ended data exploration scenario.

### Personality Traits and Spatial Skills Are Related to Group Dynamics and Success During Collective Wayfinding

Brunyé, T. T., Hendel, D., Gardony, A. L., Hussey, E. K., & Taylor, H. A. (2024). **Personality traits and spatial skills are related to group dynamics and success during collective wayfinding.** Collective Spatial Cognition, 60-99.

<details open class="relevant-callout">
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div>
This chapter reviews and identifies gaps in research examining collective navigation and describes the results of a small study aimed at better elucidating the independent and interactive roles of personality and spatial skill in guiding group wayfinding dynamics, wayfinding performance, and spatial memory. In this study, individuals, dyads, and triads completed a series of individual differences tasks and questionnaires, and an individual or shared (dyads and triads) virtual wayfinding experience involving planning and executing routes between origin and destination pairs. Navigators were provided with a single digital map that they could share during the task; patterns of map sharing, virtual navigation, and wayfinding performance were logged. Higher spatial anxiety was associated with more map viewing among group members, higher scores on questionnaires assessing autism-type traits were associated with lower group cohesion, higher group heterogeneity was associated with lower group cohesion and lower path efficiency, and triads tended to have poorer memory for the location of goal locations relative to individuals and dyads. Results speak to the inherent complexity and dynamics of collective navigation, the need for understanding individual differences in guiding group behavior, and the value of continuing research in this domain.

### Wayfinding in pairs: Comparing the planning and navigation performance of dyads and individuals in a real-world environment.

Bae, C., Montello, D., & Hegarty, M. (2024). **Wayfinding in pairs: Comparing the planning and navigation performance of dyads and individuals in a real-world environment.** Cognitive Research: Principles and Implications, 9(1), 40. https://doi.org/10.1186/s41235-024-00563-9

<details open class="relevant-callout">
<summary>Abstract</summary>
<div>
Navigation is essential to life, and it is cognitively complex, drawing on abilities such as prospective and situated planning, spatial memory, location recognition, and real-time decision-making. In many cases, day-to-day navigation is embedded in a social context where cognition and behavior are shaped by others, but the great majority of existing research in spatial cognition has focused on individuals. The two studies we report here contribute to our understanding of social wayfinding, assessing the performance of paired and individual navigators on a real-world wayfinding task in which they were instructed to minimize time and distance traveled. In the first study, we recruited 30 pairs of friends (familiar dyads); in the second, we recruited 30 solo participants (individuals). We compare the two studies to the results of an earlier study of 30 pairs of strangers (unfamiliar dyads). We draw out differences in performance with respect to spatial, social, and cognitive considerations. Of the three conditions, solo participants were least successful in reaching the destination accurately on their initial attempt. Friends traveled more efficiently than either strangers or individuals. Working with a partner also appeared to lend confidence to wayfinders: dyads of either familiarity type were more persistent than individuals in the navigation task, even after encountering challenges or making incorrect attempts. Route selection was additionally impacted by route complexity and unfamiliarity with the study area. Navigators explicitly used ease of remembering as a planning criterion, and the resulting differences in route complexity likely influenced success during enacted navigation.
